    puts "Hello, world!"

I think that's required for first blog posts on technical topics.

## Now that that's out of the way

Welcome to the first post on the Travis blog! Hopefully we'll end up having a
bunch of great content for you here.

## We? Who's this 'we'?

Me, of course. Duh. Specifically? I'm [Steve Klabnik](https://github.com/steveklabnik).
I'm heading up the Travis documentation. But [this entire website is on
GitHub](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci.github.com/), so if you
were so inclined, 'we' could also mean 'you!'

Got a new fun project on Travis? Have you recently added some fun code,
or found a new feature useful? Write a post! It's good for you!

## Why you should read this blog

I'll _also_ be trying to make posts roughly once a week letting you know
what's new in the world of Travis. We've got a bunch of contributors,
and lots of exciting stuff going on, so it's hard to keep up! Just check
out this blog, it's much easier than reading the commit list. ;)

Oh, and if you want to subscribe via RSS, grab the [Travis blog feed
