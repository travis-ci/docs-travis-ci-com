[Engine Yard](http://engineyard.com) has always been a great supporter of open
source, the Ruby ecosystem, and Travis too. So today we're thrilled to
announce that [Piotr Sarnacki](http://twitter.com/drogus) is being sponsored by
Engine Yard to work on Travis CI.

Piotr is a Rails contributor, he's made [Rails engines
awesome](http://piotrsarnacki.com/2010/09/14/mountable-engines/) and,
depending on the angle, he looks a bit like Nicolas Cage.

Engine Yard have been avid supporters of Travis already, having joined the ranks
of sponsors during our [Love](http://love.travis-ci.org) campaign. Now they're
enabling us to push Travis further and bring more goodness to the open source
community!

With the sponsorship, Piotr joins the Engine Yard OSS Grant Program.

Already, he's built support for secure environment variables, allowing you to
store important credentials in your .travis.yml securely.

Recently, he's been putting a lot of great work into our new user interface, now
fully based on Ember.js. Expect a blog post on it very soon!

Welcome to the team, Piotr. And thank you so much for the sponsorship, Engine Yard.
We're looking forward to seeing more goodness being shipped soon!
