Recently I've added a small new feature to the [Travis web client](https://travis-ci.org),
a list of currently running jobs. It's just under the workers list on the right sidebar:

![Running jobs view](http://drogus-s3itch.s3.amazonaws.com/Travis_CI_-_Free_Hosted_Continuous_Integration_Platform_for_the_Open_Source_Community-20130207-220703.jpg)

It is very useful if you need to check which of your jobs are currently running on travis.

Enjoy!
