A fresh list of things to read for you, relevant to the general interests around
continuous integration and application architecture, and a special birthday
treat to boot!

### [Micro Service Architecture](http://yobriefca.se/blog/2013/04/29/micro-service-architecture/)

A great post on breaking up your application into physically and logically
separated services and the challenges and questions that come along with it.

### [Continuous Delivery](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html)

Martin Fowler gives a short overview of the principles and ideas of continuous
delivery, which is more than just having an automated way of deploying to
production (which we just so happened to [launch
yesterday](/blog/2013-07-09-introducing-continuous-deployment-to-heroku/)).
Continuous delivery is a matter of company culture. Make sure to look at [Jez
Humble's book](http://amzn.to/12hbLko) on the topic too.

### [Using Travis CI for Racket Projects](http://www.greghendershott.com/2013/07/using-travis-ci-for-racket-projects.html)

Greg Hendershott wrote up a great guide on using Travis CI for projects written
in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org), a Lisp dialect.

### My birthday treat to you!
