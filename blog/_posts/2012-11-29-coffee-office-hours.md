The Travis team loves two things a lot: coffee and meeting people. We also like
to hug the people we meet. So why not combine all three and get to know users
and customers better and meet them in person?

Today we're announcing the Travis Coffee Office Hours. You can meet and chat
with the Travis team and enjoy some fine coffees, and cake too. Mmmmmmm, cake.
The coffee's on us, of course!

To start things off, we'll be hanging out our favorite coffee shops in Berlin
and in Wellington on Thursday, December 6. Please stop by if you want to chat
about Travis, infrastructure, continuous integration, or anything that's on your
mind.

### Café CK, Berlin

In Berlin, you can meet Konstantin, Sven and myself at [Café
CK](http://cafeck.tumblr.com) on Marienburger Straße. We'll be hanging out there
from 14:00 to 18:00 CET.

Café CK is a great coffee spot, a must-visit if you're in Berlin. It's run by
a coffee cupping champion, and they serve a fine selection of coffee roasted in
Munich freshly brewed in all kinds of ways.

### Flight Coffee Hangar, Wellington

Josh has made his way back to the home island, and is spending some quality time
in Wellington, New Zealand. He's keen to give out free hugs and to have some
great coffee along with it.

He even got his pretty face impregnated on a flat white once, for all eternity.
Oh wait, no, someone accidentally drank that coffee.

He's going to be at [Flight Coffee
Hangar](http://restaurants.nzherald.co.nz/restaurant/flight-coffee-hangar-wellington) from 14:00 NZDT. Come say hi and give
the guy a hug!

Hope to see you there! If you can't make it, not to worry, we plan to make this
a recurring occasion.
