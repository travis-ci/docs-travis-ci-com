There's a lot of great content out there on the topic of testing, and we'd like
to present some of our favorites.

### [From 15 hours to 15 seconds: reducing a crushing build time](http://devblog.songkick.com/2012/07/16/from-15-hours-to-15-seconds-reducing-a-crushing-build-time/)

A great story from the Songkick engineering team about how they cut down their
testing time significantly by refocusing on what they test, and how their entire
application is architected.

### [Using postgression on Travis CI](http://www.dpiddy.net/2013/05/12/postgression-on-travis-ci.html)

Dan Peterson from Heroku wrote a great article on how to use postgression, a
service to get a PostgreSQL 9.2 testing instance on demand via an API, with
Travis CI.

[Postgression](http://www.postgression.com) is a great service built on top of
Heroku Postgres that gives you a clean Postgres instance for testing on demand.

If your project depends on PostgreSQL 9.2 in particular, this will come in
handy!

### [Android Builds on Travis CI with Maven](http://blog.crowdint.com/2013/05/17/android-builds-on-travis-ci-with-maven.html?utm_source=blogpost&utm_medium=travis-ci&utm_campaign=maven-05172013)

The fine folks at Crowd Interactive wrote about how to setup Android projects
with Maven on Travis CI.
