To celebrate an awesome [Rails Camp](http://railscamps.com/#nz_mar_2013) at [Camp Kaitoke](http://ymcawellington.org.nz/campkaitoke/), and as a goodbye to the amazing city which I call home as I disappear overseas for another year, Travis will be holding an Open Office Hours at [Lamason Brew Bar](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Lamason-Brew-Bar/267527119927052) at the [corner of Lombard & Bond St](http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?v=2&pc=FACEBK&mid=8100&where1=corner+of+Lombard+%26+Bond+St+%2C+Wellington%2C+New+Zealand&FORM=FBKPL0&name=Lamason+Brew+Bar&mkt=en-GB) in Wellington, New Zealand.
