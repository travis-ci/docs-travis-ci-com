A while ago, [Hari Menon](https://twitter.com/menonHari) set out to build a
mobile app using PhoneGap. Luckily for our community, he started working on a
mobile client for Travis CI.

The result is [Mantis CI](http://floydpink.github.io/Mantis-CI/), an iOS and
Android app, allowing you to interact with your repositories on Travis CI,
available on both the [Apple App
Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/travis-ci-mobile/id665742482?mt=8&uo=4) and [Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floydpink.android.travisci).

Hari wrote up a [great post on how Mantis CI came
about](http://www.harimenon.com/blog/2013/09/09/the-story-behind-mantis-ci/) and
the challenges he had to tackle to get it up and running and into the App Store.

Thank you, Hari!
