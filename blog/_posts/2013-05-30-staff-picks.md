Hey, it's Thursday, and we just had lots of coffee! Time for a new round of

### [7 Ways to Refactor Fat ActiveRecord Models](http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/10/17/7-ways-to-decompose-fat-activerecord-models/)

Bryan from [Code Climate](http://codeclimate.com) is laying down a few excellent
patterns to help you decompose ActiveRecord models that gathered a bit of
weight, slowing down your tests, complecting your code base.

In my experience, adding these patterns to your workflow will not only give you
a cleaner code base, but it will also help you to get a faster test suite.

### [NSHipster: Unit Testing](http://nshipster.com/unit-testing/)

Mattt Thompson, author of [AFNetworking](http://afnetworking.com) has written a great guide on how to get set up testing
Objective-C code. He has also included a section on automating test runs,
outlining the steps required to get started with Objective-C on Travis CI.

### [Android Builds on Travis CI with Gradle](http://blog.crowdint.com/2013/05/24/android-builds-on-travis-ci-with-gradle.html)

Crowd Interactive is continuing their series on doing Android builds and testing
on Travis CI, this time with Gradle.

### [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org)

more women involved with open source. They're currently [collecting
donations](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/campaign) to make the project
happen, you should consider supporting them too!
