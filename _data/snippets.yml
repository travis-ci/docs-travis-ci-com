  ### Conditional Deploys

  You can deploy only when certain conditions are met.
  See [Conditional Releases with `on:`](/user/deployment#conditional-releases-with-on).
before_and_after: |
  ### Running commands before and after deploy

  Sometimes you want to run commands before or after deploying. You can use the `before_deploy` and `after_deploy` stages for this. These will only be triggered if Travis CI is actually deploying.

  ```yaml
  before_deploy: "echo 'ready?'"
  deploy:
    ..
    after_deploy:
      - ./after_deploy_1.sh
      - ./after_deploy_2.sh
  ```

concurrent_jobs: |
  The maximum number of concurrent jobs depends on the total system load, but
  one situation in which you might want to set a particular limit is:

  - if your build depends on an external resource and might run into a race
    condition with concurrent jobs.
auto_cancellation: |
  If you are only interested in building the most recent commit on each branch you can use this new feature to automatically cancel older builds that are in the **queued** state and are not yet running.
cron_jobs: |
  Travis CI cron jobs work similarly to the cron utility; they run builds at regular scheduled intervals independently of whether any commits were pushed to the repository. Cron jobs always fetch the most recent commit on a particular branch and build the project at that state. Cron jobs can run `daily`, `weekly` or `monthly`, which in practice means up to an hour after the selected time span, and you cannot set them to run at a specific time.
environment_variables: |
  Variables defined in repository settings are the same for all builds, and when you restart an old build, it uses the latest values. These variables are not automatically available to forks.

  Define variables in the Repository Settings that:

  - differ per repository.
  - contain sensitive data, such as third-party credentials.
contact_enterprise_support: |
  To get in touch with us, please write a message to
  [enterprise@travis-ci.com](mailto:enterprise@travis-ci.com). If possible,
  please include as much of the following as you can:

  - Description of the problem - what are you observing?
  - Which steps did you try already?
  - A support bundle (see table below on how to obtain it)
  - Log files from all workers (They can be found at `/var/log/upstart/travis-worker.log` - please include as many as you can retrieve).
  - If a build failed or errored, a text file of the build log

  |   TCI Enterprise version | Support bundle |
  | :---                     | :---           |
  | **3.x**                  | Run `kubectl kots admin-console -n [namespace]` to access admin console on `http://localhost:8800`<br />Support bundle generation instruction is available in ‘troubleshoot’ menu or directly at: `http://localhost:8800/app/tci-enterprise-kots/troubleshoot`<br /><br />A command for generating support bundle will appear after selecting: <br />`If you'd prefer, [click here]() to get a command to manually generate a support bundle.` |
  | **2.x+**                 | You can get it from `https://<your-travis-ci-enterprise-domain>:8800/support` |

  Since the announcement in Q3 2020, the most up to date version of Travis CI Enterprise is 3.x line.
  There are not any new releases for version 2.2 and the support patches has been limited since March 2021 as well. 
  For existing users of Travis CI 2.x we strongly recommend upgrading to the latest Travis CI Enterprise 3.x.

  Have you made any customizations to your setup? While we may be able to see some
  information (such as hostname, IaaS provider, and license expiration), there
  are many other things we cannot see which could lead to something not working.
  Therefore, we would like to ask you to also answer the questions below in your
  support request (if applicable):

  - How many machines are you using / what is your Kubernetes cluster setup?
  - Do you use configuration management tools (Chef, Puppet)?
  - Which other services do interface with Travis CI Enterprise?
  - Which Version Control system (VCS) do you use together with Travis CI Enterprise (e.g. github.com, GitHub Enterprise, or BitBucket Cloud)?
  - If you are using GitHub Enterprise, which version of it?

  We are looking forward to helping!
enterprise_2_encryption_key_backup: |
  To make a backup of encryption keys in TCIE 2.x, please follow these steps:

  1. Open an SSH connection to the platform machine.
  2. Open a bash session with `root` privileges on the Travis CI container by running `travis bash`.
  3. Run the following command to obtain the key: `grep -A1 encryption: /usr/local/travis/etc/travis/config/travis.yml`.
  4. Create a backup of the value returned by the previous command by either writing it down on a piece of paper or storing it on a different computer.
enterprise_3_encryption_key_backup: |
  To make a backup of encryption keys in TCIE 3.x, please follow these steps:

  1. Make sure you have appropriate access to the kubernetes cluster: you need credentials for `kubectl` and connection to [travis-api-pod]
  2. Run `kubectl exec -it [travis-api-pod] cat /app/config/travis.yml |grep -A 2 encryption` (using Travis API pod is recommended).
  3. Create a backup of the value returned by that command by either writing it down on a piece of paper or storing it on a different computer.
github_oauth_access_rights: |
  When you sign in to [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com) using GitHub for the first time, you will receive a message from GitHub saying:

  > Travis CI by travis-pro wants to access your [account name] account.

  and in the repositories section it will state:

  > This application will be able to read and write all public and private repository data.

  This is not how Travis CI accesses your data, however we can explain it later in the process.

  The warning is triggered due to GitHub OAuth App permissions which Travis CI uses, and due to the available granularity of permission scopes (see GitHub [Scopes for OAuth Apps documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps) ).

  **Travis CI does not access all your repositories by default**.

  Once you acknowledge the access rights, you will see Travis CI OAuth application present in your GitHub [Authorized OAuth Apps list](https://github.com/settings/applications), however **you need to explicitly configure which repositories Travis CI has access to** within your [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com) account. The configuration is done during the activation of Travis CI for your repositories. You can use either the 'All repositories' option or the 'Only select repositories' option during the activation process.

  When the Travis CI activation has completed, you will see the actual Travis CI GitHub Application installed in [Installed GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/installations) section.

  Travis CI uses OAuth permissions in the following way:

  1) Travis CI's system synchronizes certain metadata with GitHub. This metadata is required for proper service functioning. In particular, we sync users, orgs, memberships, repos, permissions and, (optionally) branches. This type of sync happens either once a day by schedule or per the user's request. You can find more information and source code [in this repository](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-github-sync#syncs)

  2) In order to run builds, Travis CI's system clones a repository, from which the build is triggered, to the build environment. The build environment is an isolated virtual machine or an LXD container, which gets terminated as soon as the build finishes. Cloning happens only after a build request, and therefore only for the repositories explicitly enabled at GitHub settings.

  3) To set up a build environment and prepare the build, Travis CI's system fetches and processes the `.travis.yml` config file from the repository and the branch explicitly specified in the build request, triggered by GitHub.

  4) Travis CI's system reports build results back to GitHub via its [Checks API](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/).
git_repository_settings_forks_general: |
  > Repository security settings for forked repositories on Git are available starting March 1st, 2022.
  
  For Git repositories, you may manage per repository how the [environment variables](/user/environment-variables/) and the [custom SSH keys](/user/private-dependencies/#user-key) will be handled in Travis CI when a build triggered as an effect of filing a Pull Request from a forked repository. Two settings are available specifically for this purpose, allowing you to customize your security vs. collaboration setup.

  **base repository** - a Git repository, which is forked by someone else
  **fork** or **forked repository** - any Git repository forked from the **base repository**
  **PR** - Pull Request (e.g. in GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab) or Merge Request (in Assembla).

  > Please note: Repositories activated in [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com ) before **March 1st, 2022** will have the `Share encrypted environment variables with forks (PRs) ` setting set to OFF. Please verify your collaboration model if necessary (especially for public repositories). The `Share SSH keys with forks (PRs)` will be set to ON for private repositories not to break too many collaboration setups.
  Repository settings will be set by default to OFF for any repository activated in [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com) after **March 1st, 2022**. For repositories activated in Travis CI after **March 1st, 2022**, you may want to consider changing the default settings depending on your collaboration model.
git_repository_settings_forks_encrypted_env_variables: |
  ### Share encrypted environment variables with forks (PRs) 
  
  This setting determines if the base repository´s encrypted environment variables will be shared with the forked repository in a fork-to-base pull request (the fork repository merges changes into the base repository). 

  In the case of a base-to-base pull request (changes are merged from the **base repository** into itself), the encrypted environment variables will always be available. This allows collaborators to file Pull Requests using the repository encrypted environment variables and preserve existing checks configured, e.g. in GitHub.

  In the case of a fork-to-fork pull request (changes are merged from the **forked repository** into itself), the encrypted environment variables from the **base repository** will never be available. Therefore, one needs to replace or bypass them directly in **forked repository**.

  In the case of a fork-to-base pull request:
  * If this setting is ON, the encrypted environment variables will be available to the forked repository, which means that builds in the **forked repository** will have access to the encrypted environment variables from the **base repository**. This may be a less secure approach yet allows for a collaboration using forks and Pull Requests (PRs).
  * If this setting is OFF and the build relies on any encrypted environment variable, the PR from **fork** to **base repository** will fail. This secures your **base repository** encrypted environmental variables by putting a constraint on accessing them from **forks**.
git_repository_settings_forks_ssh_keys: |
  ### Share SSH keys with forks (PRs)
  
  > Please Note: The ‘Share SSH keys with forks (PRs)’ repository setting is applicable only for private repositories in the [travis-ci.com](https://app.travis-ci.com) environment. 
  
  This setting determines if the custom SSH keys from the **base repository** will be shared with the **forked repository** in a fork-to-base pull request (changes are merged from the fork repository into the base repository). In the case of a base-to-base pull request (changes are merged from the base repository into itself), the custom SSH keys will always be available. 
  
  In the case of a fork-to-fork pull request (changes are merged from the forked repository into itself), the custom SSH keys from the base repository will never be available.
 
  In the case of a fork-to-base pull request: 
  * if this setting is ON, the custom SSH keys from the base repository will be available to the **forked repository**, which means that the build in the forked repository will be able to use the custom SSH keys from the base repository. Consider setting to ON if your collaboration model requires working with Pull Requests (PRs) from forked repositories or there are dependencies defined, which rely on SSH key from **base repository**.
  * If this setting is OFF and the build is relying on custom SSH keys i.e. for fetching some additional dependencies, it will fail with a no access error.
