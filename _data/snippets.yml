  ### Conditional Deploys

  You can deploy only when certain conditions are met.
  See [Conditional Releases with `on:`](/user/deployment#Conditional-Releases-with-on%3A).

  ### Running commands before and after deploy

  Sometimes you want to run commands before or after deploying. You can use the `before_deploy` and `after_deploy` stages for this. These will only be triggered if Travis CI is actually deploying.

  ```yaml
  before_deploy: "echo 'ready?'"
  deploy:
    ..
    after_deploy:
      - ./after_deploy_1.sh
      - ./after_deploy_2.sh
  ```

  > Avoid this problem by specifying a regularly updated branch for your automated builds.

  ## Contact Enterprise Support
  
  To get in touch with us, please write a message to 
  [enterprise@travis-ci.com](mailto:enterprise@travis-ci.com). If possible, 
  please include as much of the following info as you:
   
  - What is the problem?
  - Which steps did you try already?
  - A support bundle (You can get it from `https://yourdomain:8800/support`)
  - Worker log files (They can be found at `/var/log/upstart/travis-worker.log`) 
  - If you're using multiple worker machines, we need the log files from all of them.
  
  Is anything special with your setup? While we may be able to see some 
  information (such as hostname, IaaS provider, and license expiration), there 
  are many other things we can't see which could lead to something not working. 
  Therefore , we'd like to ask you to also answer the questions below in your 
  support request (if applicable):
  
  - How many machines are you using?
  - Do you use configuration management tools (Chef, Puppet)?
  - Which other services do interface with Travis CI Enterprise?
  - Do you use Travis CI Enterprise together with github.com or GitHub Enterprise?
  - If you're using GitHub Enterprise, which version of it?
  
  We're looking forward helping!
