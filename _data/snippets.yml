  ### Conditional Deploys

  You can deploy only when certain conditions are met.
  See [Conditional Releases with `on:`](/user/deployment#Conditional-Releases-with-on%3A).

  ### Running commands before and after deploy

  Sometimes you want to run commands before or after deploying. You can use the `before_deploy` and `after_deploy` stages for this. These will only be triggered if Travis CI is actually deploying.

  ```yaml
  before_deploy: "echo 'ready?'"
  deploy:
    ..
    after_deploy:
      - ./after_deploy_1.sh
      - ./after_deploy_2.sh
  ```
