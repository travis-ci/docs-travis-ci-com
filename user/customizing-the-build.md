## Limiting Concurrent Builds

The maximum number of concurrent builds depends on the total system load, but
one situation in which you might want to set a particular limit is:

- if your build depends on an external resource and might run into a race
  condition with concurrent builds.

You can set the maximum number of concurrent builds in the settings pane for
each repository.

![Settings -> Limit concurrent builds](/images/screenshots/concurrent-builds-how-to.png)

Or using the command line client:

```bash
$ travis settings maximum_number_of_builds --set 1
```

## Building only the latest commit

If you are only interested in building the most recent commit on each branch you can use this new feature to automatically cancel older builds in the queue that are *not yet running*.

The *Auto Cancellation Setting* is in the Settings tab of each repository, and you can enable it separately for:

* *pushes* - which build your branch and appear in the *Build History* tab of your repository.

* *pull requests* - which build the future merge result of your feature branch against its target and appear in the *Pull Requests* tab of your repository.

For example, in the following screenshot, we pushed commit `ca31c2b` to the branch `MdA-fix-notice` while builds #226 and #227 were queued. With the auto cancellation feature on, the builds #226 and #227 were automatically cancelled:

## Git Clone Depth

Travis CI clones repositories to a depth of 50 commits, which is only really useful if you are performing git operations.

> Please note that if you use a depth of 1 and have a queue of jobs, Travis CI won't build commits that are in the queue when you push a new commit.

You can set the [clone depth](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) in `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
git:
  depth: 3
```

## Git Submodules

Travis CI clones git submodules by default, to avoid this set:

```yaml
git:
  submodules: false
```

## Git LFS Skip Smudge

You can disable the download of LFS objects when cloning ([`git lfs smudge
--skip`](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/master/docs/man/git-lfs-smudge.1.ronn))
by setting the following in `.travis.yml`:

``` yml
git:
  lfs_skip_smudge: true
```



## Skipping a build

If you don't want to run a build for a particular commit for any reason, add `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` to the git commit message.

Commits that have `[ci skip]` or `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit messages are ignored by Travis CI.


## Custom Hostnames

If your build requires setting up custom hostnames, you can specify a single host or a
list of them in your .travis.yml. Travis CI will automatically setup the
hostnames in `/etc/hosts` for both IPv4 and IPv6.

```yaml
addons:
  hosts:
  - travis.dev
  - joshkalderimis.com
```

## What repository providers or version control systems can I use?

Build and test your open source projects hosted on GitHub on [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/).

Build and test your private repositories hosted on GitHub on [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com/).

Travis CI currently does not support git repositories hosted on Bitbucket or GitLab, or other version control systems such as Mercurial.
