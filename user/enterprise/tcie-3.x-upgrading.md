## Backups

> Before upgrading, we **strongly recommend** making a backup of PostgreSQL database, Redis and RabbitMQ data.

It is recommended that your Travis CI Enterprise (TCIE) deployment recipes are automated. Thus backing up just data should be sufficient strategy to restore the TCIE 3.x installation from scratch and fill it with the data from the backup/dump files.

### Encryption Key

Without the encryption key you cannot access the information in your production database. To make sure that you can always recover your database, make a backup of this key.

> Without the encryption key the information in the database is not recoverable.

## Updating your Travis CI Enterprise Platform

Run `kubectl kots admin-console -n [namspace]` to access admin console on `http://localhost:8800`.

Click *Check for updates* in *Version history* menu:

If thereâ€™s a new version it will appear in *all versions* list. Click *deploy* to replace current installation with a new version:

> There will be a small amount of downtime while an update is installed. For this reason we recommend that you perform each update during a maintenance window.

## Updating Replicated on the Platform

To update Replicated KOTS version on the Platform installation you'll want to run
following command:

`curl https://kots.io/install | bash`


## Updating your Travis CI Enterprise Worker

### On Ubuntu 16.04 and later

On Ubuntu 16.04 and later, travis-worker ships inside a Docker container. To update travis-worker, please follow the steps below.

  1. Configure the new image by editing the Docker tag in `/etc/systemd/system/travis-worker.service.d/env.conf`:
  ```
  [Service]
  Environment="TRAVIS_WORKER_SELF_IMAGE=travisci/worker:v4.6.1"
  ```
  1. Reload the configuration and restart the service:
  ```
  $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  $ sudo systemctl restart travis-worker
  ```

## Restoring from Backups

In the rare event something goes wrong and/or you'd like to restore from a backup, please use the following steps:

1. Make sure you have backed up PostgreSQL database, Redis and RabbitMQ data - these services should be separate pods in Kubernetes cluster or run by you externally to TCIE 3.x installation
2. Make a fresh install of Travis CI
3. Restore the data in aforementioned tools in respective pods using their specific restore commands
