This document contains guidelines to follow in case your Travis CI Enterprise production installation becomes unresponsive or unavailable.

If your Travis CI Enterprise production installation becomes unresponsive, please follow the steps outlined in this document before contacting us, the data you collect helps us solve your problem efficiently.

Throughout this document we'll be using the following terms to refer to the two components of your Travis CI Enterprise installation:

- `Platform machine`: The virtual machine that runs most of the Travis web components. This is the machine your domain is pointing to.
- `Worker machine`: The worker machine(s) run your builds.

## Back up your encryption key

Without the encryption key you cannot access the information in your production database. To make sure that you can always recover your database, make a backup of this key:

1. open a ssh connection to the platform machine
2. run `travis bash`. This will open a bash session with `root` privileges into the Travis container.
3. Then run `cat /usr/local/travis/etc/travis/config/travis.yml | grep -A1 encryption:`. Create a backup of the value returned by that command by either writing it down on a piece of paper or storing it on a different computer.

> Without this key the information in the database is not recoverable.

## Create a backup of the data directories

The data directories are located on the platform machine and get mounted into the Travis container. In these directories you'll find files from RabbitMQ, Postgres, Slanger and Postgresql.

The files are located at `/var/travis` on the platform machine. Please run `sudo tar -czvf travis-enterprise-data-backup.tar.gz /var/travis` to create compressed archive from this folder. After this has finished, copy this file off the machine to a secure location.

## Write a support request

We encourage you to get in touch with us for anything you'd like to talk about but especially when something is not working â€“ we're here to help!

There are a few things we'd like to ask you to take care of when you're getting in touch with us to make sure that we can provide the best support possible.

1. Also, please make sure that you have root access on all machines Travis CI Enterprise is running on.

2. Support bundle: Please head over to https://<your domain>:8800/support and create a support bundle. This compressed archive contains log files from our services but also information about your system in general like number of CPUs, RAM, operating system etc.

3. Also please include the worker log files as well. They're located on your worker machine(s) at `/var/log/upstart/travis-worker.log`. If you run multiple worker machines, please grab this file from all machines.

4. Anything else which is specific to your infrastructure / setup:
	- Are you running on a IaaS (Amazon EC2, Azure, Digital Ocean)?
	- Do you use configuration management tools (Chef, Puppet)?
	- Which other services do interface with Travis CI Enterprise?
	- Do you use Travis CI Enterprise together with github.com or GitHub Enterprise?

## What exactly is not running?

What unusual behaviour are you seeing right now?

- A build does not get picked up?
- A build does not get enqueued after a `git push` or a freshly created Pull Request?
- ...

When you're writing to us, please include this information. We're also interested in recent changes in your IT landscape. For instance: Did your GitHub Enterprise Installation receive an update recently?

## Firewall

Are all machines online? Can they talk to each other? Please check this beforehand. If you're using a firewall, please make sure that these ports are open and the machines accept traffic on these:

__Worker:__

- Port 22 for SSH access

__Platform machine__:

- Port 22 for SSH access
- Port 443 for HTTPS traffic
- Port 80 for HTTP traffic
- Port 4567 & 5672 for RabbitMQ traffic
- Port 8800 for management dashboard https traffic

## Hardware

To ensure everything runs as expected, does your system meet our [hardware requirements](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/enterprise/prerequisites/#System-Requirements)?

Our preflight checks can help you to determine if the platform machine has enough resources to run Travis CI Enterprise. To run the checks, open a ssh connection to your platform machine and run the following command:

```bash
$ replicatedctl preflight run
```

## Docker

We use a tool called [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/) to distribute Travis CI Enterprise. It also provides the management dashboard you're using to configure settings your installation.

Replicated and Travis CI Enterprise are both shipped as Docker containers. Therefore we have to rely on a perfectly working Docker installation. In the past we've seen incidents where the customers production system became unavailable because Docker related configuration has changed for various reasons.

Therefore we need to have some things in line:

- Your currently used Docker version needs to be at least 1.7 on both platform and worker machines.
- For the platform machine, these port bindings have to be in place (run `sudo docker ps -a` and look for a container whose name starts with `quay.io-travisci-te-main`):
	- 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
	- 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp
	- 0.0.0.0:4567->4567/tcp
	- 0.0.0.0:5672->5672/tcp
	- 0.0.0.0:32770->22/tcp
- If the above port bindings are not there, please let us know. Then we'll figure out how to get them back.
- Storage drivers: The platform machine by default uses `aufs` on Ubuntu 14.04. The worker machines either have `aufs` or `devicemapper` configured, depending on the installer you used to set them up. Where `aufs` is the default and for AWS based worker setups we also offer `devicemapper`, where this requires a more elaborate setup though. To find out which storage driver is currently in use, run the following: `sudo docker info | grep "Storage Driver"`.

## Worker

The `travis-worker` binary on the worker machine(s) must be up to date.
Please run `sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade travis-worker`. This will update it to the latest version.

__Docker__:

Since the worker machine runs all your builds in Docker containers, the Docker version must be up to date and properly configured. We also need to have the `aufs` or `devicemapper` storage driver configured here, together with Linux kernel 3.18 or later.

Please also check the worker configuration in `/etc/default/travis-enterprise`:

- Please make sure that `TRAVIS_ENTERPRISE_BUILD_ENDPOINT` is not commented out and has the value `__build__`.
- Also make sure that `TRAVIS_ENTERPRISE_SECURITY_TOKEN` has the same value as being shown under RabbitMQ password at `https://your.domain:8800/settings`.
- The hostname in `TRAVIS_ENTERPRISE_HOST` must have the platform machine's hostname as value.

It is possible to adjust travis-worker so for example it assigns  more resources to a container or runs more of them concurrently. This configuration has to be done in `/etc/default/travis-worker`. There are some things worth to check:

- `TRAVIS_WORKER_POOL_SIZE` cannot exceed the number of available CPUs the machine has.

## GitHub Enterprise

If you're using GitHub Enterprise, please let us know which version you're using and if you've updated recently. This is important because we had some cases in the past where a GitHub Enterprise behaves differently than github.com.

## Your setup

Last but not least, please tell us as much as you can about your setup. What is different from our recommended setup? Did you change anything lately (software / hardware upgrades)? This will help us a lot to work out a solution together with you.
