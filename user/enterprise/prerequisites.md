Before [installing Travis CI Enterprise](/user/enterprise/installation/), make
sure that you have all of the following prerequisites:  

- At least two dedicated [hosts or hypervisors](#host-machine-specs)
- A GitHub Enterprise [OAuth app](#OAuth-app)
- A valid [Travis CI Enterprise license](#license)

## Host Machine Specs

The standard setup consists of **two hosts**, the *Travis CI Enterprise
Platform* which hosts the web UI and related services, and one or more
*Worker hosts* which run the tests/jobs in isolated containers using LXC
and Docker.

### System Requirements

Each dedicated host or hypervisor (VMWare, OpenStack using KVM, or EC2) should
run **Ubuntu 14.04**, ideally using Linux 3.16 and have at least **16 gigs of
RAM and 8 CPUs** (if you're using EC2 we recommend the **c3.2xlarge** instance
type).

Each host requires:

- a [Travis CI Enterprise license](#license)
- A GitHub Enterprise [OAuth app](#OAuth-app)

## OAuth App

Travis CI Enterprise connects to GitHub Enterprise via OAuth. You will need to
create an OAuth app on your GitHub Enterprise that Travis CI Enterprise can
connect to.

<!-- TODO: link to GH OAuth app -->

Use the following URLs when you register the OAuth app:

- *Homepage URL* - `https://travis-ci.<your-domain>.com`
- *Authorization callback URL* - https://travis-ci.<your-domain>.com/api
