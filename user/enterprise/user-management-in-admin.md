Travis CI Enterprise (TCIE) offers a new tab for admin users utilizing `admin-v2`, the **User Activity** tab, where admin users can see `active` or `inactive` users and suspend or unsuspend specific users. 

> Note: An `active` user is a user who utilizes the system and not necessarily a user consuming a license. 

This section describes how to obtain and use an Organizational-level token.

## Obtain Organization-level token

A new token authorization method was introduced in Travis API **org.token**. An organization-level access token that grants permissions to perform platform-level administrative commands via APIs.

Travis CI Enterprise platform admin users require a list of active and inactive user accounts to make informed decisions about whether to suspend accounts. TCIE admin users can now obtain and regenerate organization-level tokens (OTP secured). Each token has a predefined permission. Currently, there are two possible usages for Organization-level tokens: checking user activity and suspending or unsuspending users in the organization. 

Navigate to the API Tokens section at the bottom of the Travis admin V2 Organization page. Under the Organization tab, scroll down to the **API** section.

This section displays the API key of the Organization. 
Click the “Copy” button to copy the token. 
Click the “Re-generate” button to generate a new token.

The token is hidden by default, and by clicking the **View** button, the token is displayed. 

> Note: This section is for admin users only. 

## How to use Organization-level tokens

Users can now use the following new API endpoint:
```
/org/:id/user_activity
```

Here is an example of using the command for looking for active users since Feb. 21st, 2025:
```
curl -L -v -s -k -X GET \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Travis-API-Version: 3" \
     -H "Authorization: org.token <organization id in admin-v2>:<paste your org.token here>"  \
     "https://[instance]/org/:[org id]/user_activity?date=2025-02-21&status=active"
```

Using a GET request allows users to retrieve a list of active and inactive users for a specified time between the current date and any specified date.

The status parameter accepts the `active` or `inactive` values. And enter the `date` param using the `yyyy-mm-dd` format. 

## Suspending and Unsuspending Users

The following new endpoints were introduced and can be used to suspend or unsuspend users.

```
/org/:id/suspend
/org/:id/unsuspend
/users/suspend
/users/unsuspend`
```
To suspend users based on their Travis CI ID, use the following:
```
{ "user_ids" : [1,2...]}
```

To suspend users based on their VCS TYPE and ID, use the following:
```
{ "vcs_type":"github", "vcs_ids": [100,101..]}
``` 

### Bulk Suspension
Travis CIE admin users can bulk suspend users via API or CLI by providing a list of users with their VCS IDs. 


## User Activity

![User Activity Tab](/user/images/user-activity-tab-tcie.png)

The new **User Activity** tab, available from the top bar, was introduced to Travis CI Enterprise, allowing admin users to manage Enterprise users within the organization.

In this section, you can obtain a CSV file containing a list of active and inactive users for a specified date. Simply, enter a `Date From` to generate a list of Active and Inactive users. 

## Suspend Users

![Suspend Users](/user/images/suspend-users-screen.png)

With the list you generated, you can select a subset of users for suspension by uploading a CSV file containing only the users you want to suspend. 

Once the file is uploaded, you can suspend all users from the uploaded file.

Use the **Suspend** button to suspend any user from the list.  

You can also unsuspend users by viewing the Suspend users list and clicking the **Unsuspend** button. 

> Note: The old Enterprise Users page is now a section of the new User Activity page.
