The following is a guide to getting started with Travis CI using Node.js.

## Prerequisite

Before getting started, create a `.travis.yml` file and add it to the root directory of your Node.js project.

## Specify the Language

Specify Node.js as the language and version of Node.js the project will use to let Travis CI know you are building a Node.js project. Here is an example of the configuration:

 ```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "14"
  - "16"
  - "18"
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

## Install Build Dependencies

Travis CI runs the default `npm install` command to install your dependencies.

 ```yaml
 install:
  - npm install
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

## Define the Test Command

Travis CI runs any test defined in your `package.json` file by default. Explicitly run the command as follows: 

 ```yaml
install:
  - npm install
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

## Commit and Push 

Once your `.travis.yml` file is configured, push it to your repository, and Travis CI will start running tests for each Node version specified. 

Here is the complete example:
 ```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "14"
  - "16"
  - "18"
install:
  - npm install
script:
  - npm test
 ```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}
