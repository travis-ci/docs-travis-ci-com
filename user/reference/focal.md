## What This Guide Covers

This guide provides an overview of the packages, tools and settings available in the Focal Fossa environment.

## Using Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)

To route your builds to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Focal, add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
dist: focal
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}


## Differences from the previous release images

Travis CI Ubuntu 20.04, Focal, includes the following changes and improvements:

### Third party apt-repositories removed

While third party apt-repositories are used during the image provisioning, they are all removed from the build image. This has two benefits; a) reduced risk of unrelated interference and b) faster apt-get updates.

To specify a third party apt-repository, you can [add the source with the apt addon](/user/installing-dependencies/#adding-apt-sources) and specify the packages. For example:

```yaml
dist: focal
addons:
  apt:
    sources:
      - sourceline: 'ppa:chris-lea/redis-server'
    packages:
    - redis-tools
    - redis-server
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

If you depend on these repositories in your build, you can use the following `source` line to get them back:

| package              | source                       |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------------|
| couchdb              | `deb https://apache.bintray.com/couchdb-deb $(lsb_release -cs) main`         |
| docker               | `deb https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable`              |
| google-chrome-stable | `deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main`              |
| git-ppa              | `ppa:git-core/ppa`           |
| haskell              | `ppa:hvr/ghc`                |
| mongodb              | `deb https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse`         |
| pollinate            | `ppa:pollinate/ppa`          |
| redis                | `ppa:chris-lea/redis-server` |

### Services disabled by default

On the Ubuntu 20.04 based environment, to speed up boot time and improve performance we've disabled all services by default.
Add any services that you want to start to your `.travis.yml`:


```yaml
services:
  - mysql
  - redis
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

## Environment common to all Ubuntu 20.04 images

The following versions of Docker, version control software and compilers are present on all Ubuntu 20.04 builds, along with more language specific software described in more detail in each language section.

All preinstalled software not provided by distro is installed from an official release --
either a prebuilt binary if available, or a source release built with default options.
For preinstalled language interpreters, a standard version manager like `rvm` is used if available for the language.

### Version control

| package | version  |
|:--------|:---------|
| git     | `2.28.0` |
| git-lfs | `2.9.2`  |
| hg      | `5.3`    |
| svn     | `1.13.0` |
{: style="width: 30%" }

### Compilers and Build toolchain

| package | version  |
|:--------|:---------|
| clang      | `7.0.0`  |
| llvm       | `10.0.0` |
| cmake      | `3.16.8` |

| shellcheck | `0.7.0`  |
| shfmt      | `2.6.3`  |
{: style="width: 30%" }

To use the IBM Advance Toolchain v14 compilers under `ppc64le` architecture in Focal LXD image, use the following paths in your `.travis.yml`:

- GCC compiler
  - Path: `/opt/at14.0/bin/gcc`
  - Command: `/opt/at14.0/bin/gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world`

- g++ compiler
  - Path: `/opt/at14.0/bin/g++`
  - Command: `/opt/at14.0/bin/g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world`

- Go compiler
  - Path: `/opt/at14.0/bin/gccgo`
  - Command: `/opt/at14.0/bin/gccgo hello_world.go -o hello_world`

- Python
  - First, compile Python 3.8.0 using the `python_interpreter.sh script`.
  - Python Interpreter Path: `/opt/python380-at14/python3.8`
  - Build Python Command: `sudo sh python_interpreter.sh`

To use the IBM Advance Toolchain v14 compilers under `amd64` architecture in Focal LXD image, use the following paths in your `.travis.yml`:
