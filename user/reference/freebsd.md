## Default

We use FreeBSD 12.1 as default.

## Using FreeBSD

To use FreeBSD, add the following to your your `.travis.yml`.

```yaml
os: freebsd
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

Travis CI also supports the [Ubuntu Linux Build Environment](/user/reference/linux/), [Windows Build Environment](/user/reference/windows/) 
and [macOS Build Environment](/user/reference/osx/).

> FreeBSD is available on our hosted fully virtualized infrastructure. 

### FreeBSD improvements

#### Third party pkg-repositories removed

To specify a third party pkg-repository, you can add the source with the pkg addon and specify
the packages. 

For example:

```yaml
os: freebsd
addons:
pkg:
- go
- curl
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

## Environment common to all FreeBSD 12.1 images

The following versions of version control software and compilers are present on all FreeBSD
12.1 builds, along with more language specific software described in detail below.

Any preinstalled software not provided by the distro is installed from ports â€“ either a prebuilt binary
if available, or a source release built with default options. For preinstalled language
interpreters, a standard version manager like rvm is used, if available for the language.

*  Other ruby versions can be installed during build time:
