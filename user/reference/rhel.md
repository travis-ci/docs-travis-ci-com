## Overview

This guide provides an overview of the packages, tools and settings available in the RHEL CI environment.

You can use the following distribution:

* [RHEL8](/user/reference/rhel/) **default**

## Using RHEL distributions

To use our RHEL build infrastructure, you can use the distribution above.

## Default

We use RHEL 8 as default.

## Using RHEL

To use RHEL, add the following to your your `.travis.yml`.

```yaml
os: linux
dist: rhel8
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

Travis CI also supports the [Ubuntu Linux Build Environment](/user/reference/linux/), [Windows Build Environment](/user/reference/windows/) 
and [macOS Build Environment](/user/reference/osx/).

> RHEL is available on our hosted fully virtualized infrastructure. 


## Environment common to all RHEL8 images

The following versions of version control software and compilers are present on all RHEL 8
builds, along with more language specific software described in detail below.

Any preinstalled software not provided by the distro is installed from ports â€“ either a prebuilt binary
if available, or a source release built with default options. For preinstalled language
interpreters, a standard version manager like rvm is used, if available for the language.
