### What This Guide Covers

This guide provides an overview on the different environments in which
Travis CI can run your builds, and why you might want to pick one over another.



## Virtualization environments

Each build runs in one of the following virtual environments.

### Sudo-enabled

A sudo enabled, full virtual machine per build, that runs Linux, either [Ubuntu Xenial 16.04](/user/reference/xenial/), [Ubuntu Trusty 14.04](/user/reference/trusty/), or [Ubuntu Precise 12.04](/user/reference/precise/)

### Container-based

A fast boot time environment in which `sudo` commands are not available. Running Linux [Ubuntu Trusty 14.04](/user/reference/trusty/)
> Please note that this environment is deprecated. See [the
announcement](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-10-04-combining-linux-infrastructures)
for more information.

### OS X

An [OS X](/user/reference/osx/) environment for Objective-C and other OS X specific projects

### Windows

A [Windows](/user/reference/windows/) environment running Windows Server, version 1803.

### Virtualisation Environment vs Operating System

The following table summarizes the differences across virtual environments and operating systems:

|                      | Ubuntu Precise                                 | Ubuntu Trusty                     | Ubuntu Trusty                        | Ubuntu Xenial          | [OS X](/user/reference/osx/) | [Windows](/user/reference/windows) |

> Note that the following keywords in your .travis.yml file will silently route your builds to our sudo-enabled infrastructure (even if you specify `sudo: false`): `docker`, `ping`, `sudo`.

> Available disk space is approximate and depends on the base image and language selection of your project.
  The best way to find out what is available on your specific image is to run `df -h` as part of your build script.

## What infrastructure is my environment running on?

Usually, knowing the virtualization environment characteristics from the [table above](#virtualisation-environment-vs-operating-system) is sufficient.

But, if you do need more detail, you have one of these two questions:

* you want to see what infrastructure a [finished build](#for-a-finished-build) ran on.
* you want to determine what infrastructure a [particular `.travis.yml` configuration](#for-a-particular-travisyml-configuration) will run on.

### For a finished build

To see what infrastructure a finished build ran on, look at the *hostname* at the top of the build log:

![Infrastructure shown in hostname](/images/ui/what-infrastructure.png "Infrastructure shown in hostname")

if it contains:

* `ec2`, as in the previous example → the build ran in a container-based environment on Amazon EC2.
* `gce` → the build ran in a sudo-enabled environment on Google Compute Engine.
* `wjb` → the build ran on macOS.
* `1803-containers` → the build ran on Windows.

### For a particular .travis.yml configuration

Many different parts of your `.travis.yml` affect what infrastructure your build runs on. The following list describes some of the main settings that determine build routing:

* Any of the following settings related to sudo or docker route your build to a sudo-enabled linux (Ubuntu Trusty) environment on Google Cloud Engine.

  - `services: docker`
  - `sudo: required` or `sudo: true`
  - *any* other `sudo` command in your build script
  - *any* other `docker` command in your build script

* Using `os: osx`, setting a version of Xcode using `osx_image:`, or using a macOS specific language such as `language: objective-c` routes your build to macOS infrastructure.

* Using `os: windows` routes your build to Windows infrastructure.

> Between middle of October 2018 and end December 2018 the default infrastructure
> your builds runs on will depend on a [few different
> factors](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-10-04-combining-linux-infrastructures)
> while we consolidate everything onto sudo-enabled virtual machines.

## Deprecated Virtualization Environments

Historically, Travis CI has provided the following virtualization environments.

- **Precise Container-based environment**: available from the announcement in [December, 2014](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-12-17-faster-builds-with-container-based-infrastructure/) to [September, 2017](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2017-08-31-trusty-as-default-status).
- **Legacy environment**: was available until [December, 2015](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-11-27-moving-to-a-more-elastic-future).
