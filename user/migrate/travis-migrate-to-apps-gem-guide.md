title: Migrating 50 or more private Repositories to GitHub Apps Guide
layout: en

If your organization has more than **50 active repositories** to migrate to our new GitHub Apps integration, you can use [the travis_migrate_to_apps gem](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis_migrate_to_apps) to migrate them in one sweep rather than adding them manually one by one in the GitHub UI.

> Note that you can also choose "Activate all repositories" on GitHub to select all current and future repositories, so that you can activate them at Travis CI by adding a `.travis.yml` file.

The following steps describe how to first authorize your account through GitHub Apps, get the required authentication tokens and use the [the travis_migrate_to_apps gem](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis_migrate_to_apps) to activate via GitHub Apps your private repositories:

### 1. Install the gem
```
gem install travis_migrate_to_apps
```

### 2. Generate a GitHub personal access token with repo scope

You can generate a new GitHub token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).

Choose the name of your liking and ensure to select the whole `repo` scope as shown below:

Then click the "Generate token" button at the bottom to generate the token.

You'll then be back on the GitHub token page:

Take care of copying the newly generated token and save it for later usage.

**Note: if you are migrating an organization, the token must be generated by [an owner of the GitHub organization](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization/).**

### 3. Activate the Travis CI GitHub Apps integration with 1 repo

Go to your repositories page on travis-ci.com: [https://travis-ci.com/account/repositories](https://travis-ci.com/account/repositories)

Click the "Activate GitHub Apps Integration" button highlighted below:

![Activate GitHub Apps Integration button](/images/migrate/gem-github-apps-activate.png)

You'll directed to the GitHub Apps page for the Travis CI app:

Choose at least one repository and click the "Approve & Install" button.

You'll then be redirected to [your profile page on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/profile) and the newly added repository should appear under "GitHub Apps Integration":

### 4. Get your Travis CI API token

Here are the two ways you can get this token:

1. On your profile page: https://travis-ci.com/profile

2. Via the [Travis CI client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb) by running: `travis token --com`

### 5. Run the gem

```
travis_migrate_to_apps [owner_name] [travis_access_token] [github_access_token]
```

where

- `[owner_name]` is the GitHub account (user or organization) where the repositories you want to migrate are located
- `[travis_access_token]` is the Travis CI token obtained in step #4 above
- `[github_access_token]` is the GitHub token obtained in step #2 above

### 6. Check the migration result

You can now refresh [your profile page on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/profile) and your newly migrated repositories should appear under the "GitHub Apps Integration" section.
