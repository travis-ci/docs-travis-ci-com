Travis CI can automatically upload assets from your [`$TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR`](/user/environment-variables/#Default-Environment-Variables) to your git tags on your GitHub repository.

**Please note that deploying GitHub Releases works only for tags, not for branches.**

For a minimal configuration, add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: releases
  api_key: "GITHUB OAUTH TOKEN"
  file: "FILE TO UPLOAD"
  skip_cleanup: true
  on:
    tags: true
```

> Make sure you have `skip_cleanup` set to `true`, otherwise Travis CI will delete all the files created during the build, which will probably delete what you are trying to upload.

The `on: tags: true` section at the end of the `.travis.yml` above is required to make sure that your tags get deployed.

If you need to overwrite existing files, add `overwrite: true` to the `deploy` section of your `.travis.yml`

You can also use the [Travis CI command line client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#installation) to configure `.travis.yml`:

```bash
travis setup releases
```

##  Authenticating with an Oauth token

The recommend way of authentication is with a GitHub oauth token. It must have the `public_repo` or `repo` scope to upload assets. Instead of setting it up manually, it is highly recommended to use `travis setup releases`, which will automatically create a GitHub oauth token with the correct scopes and encrypts it.

## Authentication with a Username and Password

You can also authenticate with your GitHub username and password using the `user` and `password` options. This is not recommended as it allows full access to your GitHub account but is simplest to setup. It is recommended to encrypt your password using `travis encrypt "GITHUB PASSWORD" --add deploy.password`. This example authenticates using  a username and password.

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: releases
  user: "GITHUB USERNAME"
  password: "GITHUB PASSWORD"
  file: "FILE TO UPLOAD"
  skip_cleanup: true
  on:
    tags: true
```

## Deploying to GitHub Enterprise

If you wish to upload assets to a GitHub Enterprise repository, you must override the `$OCTOKIT_API_ENDPOINT` environment variable with your GitHub Enterprise API endpoint:

```
http(s)://"GITHUB ENTERPRISE HOSTNAME"/api/v3/
```

You can configure this in [Repository Settings](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings) or via your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
env:
  global:
    - OCTOKIT_API_ENDPOINT: "GITHUB ENTERPRISE API ENDPOINT"
```

## Uploading Multiple Files

You can upload multiple files using yml array notation. This example uploads two files.

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: releases
  api_key: "GITHUB OAUTH TOKEN"
  file:
    - "FILE 1"
    - "FILE 2"
  skip_cleanup: true
  on:
    tags: true
```

## Conditional releases

You can deploy only when certain conditions are met.
See [Conditional Releases with `on:`](/user/deployment#Conditional-Releases-with-on%3A).

## Running commands before or after release

Sometimes you want to run commands before or after releasing a gem. You can use the `before_deploy` and `after_deploy` stages for this. These will only be triggered if Travis CI is actually pushing a release.

```yaml
before_deploy: "echo 'ready?'"
deploy:
  ..
after_deploy:
  - ./after_deploy_1.sh
  - ./after_deploy_2.sh
```
