Travis CI can deploy your static files to [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) after a
successful build. Builds triggered from Pull Requests will never trigger a
deploy.

You will need to set 2 environment variables in your travis settings and set the deployment provider details in `.travis.yml`

### Environment variables

- **SURGE_LOGIN**: Set it to the email address you use with Surge
- **SURGE_TOKEN**: Set it to your login token (get it by doing a `surge token`)

### Configuration of `.travis.yml`:

- Add `surge` as deployment provider in `.travis.yml`

- If your project folder is not the repo root you can set the deploy option `project` to define a path relative to repo root to deploy.

- If you do not have a `CNAME` file with the name of the domain to publish to you can set the deploy option `domain` with the domain to deploy to.

Example:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: surge
  project: ./static/
  domain: example.surge.sh  
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

### Generated content

If you are generating files for deployment you must tell the `deploy` step to keep your changes:

```yaml
deploy:
  ...
  skip_cleanup: true
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

It is suggested that you generate your files during the `script` step or the `before_deploy` step.

- When generating files during the `script` step, an error results in a failed build.
- When generating files during the `before_deploy` step, an error does *not* result in a failed build.

### Branches

By default, Travis CI will only deploy from your `master` branch. You can specify what branch to deploy from with the deploy option `on`:

```yaml
deploy:
  ...
  on: myProductionBranch
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

To deploy from all branches set the deploy->on option `all_branches` to `true`

```yaml
deploy:
  ...
  on:
    all_branches: true
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}
