## Preparation

Travis CI lets you schedule builds at regular intervals independently of whether
any commits were pushed to the repository.
This feature is not enabled by default. Please contact us if you need it:

[support@travis-ci.com](mailto:support@travis-ci.com?subject=Cron)

If this feature is enabled for your repository, there is a "Cron Jobs" settings
tab on your Travis CI page.

## Adding Cron Jobs

After optionally customizing the cron job's properties
you can click on "Add" which creates the cron job.

![adding a cron job](/images/cron-adding.png "adding a cron job")

Thereafter the cron job is displayed above:
