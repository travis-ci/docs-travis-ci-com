Cron job builds use the same notification settings as normal push builds, and you can [skip them](#Skipping-cron-Jobs) in the same way

Configure cron jobs from the "Cron Jobs" settings tab on your Travis CI page.

## Adding Cron Jobs

Select the branch to run the build on, how often to run the build, and whether to run the build if there was a build in the last 24 hours, then click "Add":

Confirm that the cron job is displayed in your settings tab:

![cron job created](/images/cron-created.png "cron job created")

## Skipping Cron Jobs

Because cron jobs build the latest commit to a particular branch, if that commit message includes [the skip command](/user/customizing-the-build/#skipping-a-build) the cron job will skip that build.

## Deleting Cron Jobs

Click the small trash icon on the right hand side of the page:

![deleting a cron job](/images/cron-deleting.png "deleting a cron job")

## Detecting Builds Triggered by Cron

To check whether a build was triggered by cron, examine the `TRAVIS_EVENT_TYPE` environment variable to see if it has the value `cron`.
