# 2019-01-14

## Changes
- Language: generic is recognized
- System Info is more readable
- PhantomJS2 is available
- Tmate is preinstalled
- Gem (and rvm) are configured to use `--no-document` rather than `--no-ri` and `--no-rdoc`.
- Ensure ip forwarding on localhost does not get interrupted once per day
    (resolves [#9696](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/9696))
- Openjdk certificates use system certificates
- Gradle daemon is not disabled anymore
- Only set `_JAVA_OPTIONS` on docker containers
- Drop hhvm support
- Chromium is not installed anymore (Google Chrome, however, continues to be installed)
- Xvfb init file is removed in favor of a systemd unit file. Xvfb can be set up with `services: xvfb`. The matching DISPLAY environment variable is made available when you do that.
