# 2017-08-17

## Schedule

[2017-08-21 18:00 UTC](http://everytimezone.com/#2017-8-21,360,c8l)

## Updated

- As previously communicated, Xcode beta versions 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 are being deprecated.
Projects configured with values of `beta-xcode6.1`, `beta-xcode6.2`, or `beta-xcode6.3`
for the `osx_image` tag will now be run on our [default OS X image](/user/reference/osx/#os-x-version).

- Users will be able to run on Xcode 6.4 by specifying `osx_image: xcode-6.4` in
their project configuration.

## Details

- More information about the differences between the new Xcode 7.3 default image and
the previous Xcode 6.1 image can be found [here](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2016-10-04-osx-73-default-image-live/).
