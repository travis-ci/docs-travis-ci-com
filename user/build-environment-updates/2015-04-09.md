# CANCELED

NOTE: We will roll back the update we rolled out on 2015-04-27 due to reports of errors.

(Originally scheduled for 2015-04-09 15:00 UTC, rescheduled to 2015-04-27 15:00 UTC.)

We have received numerous reports of various problems with the most recent updates.
They are collected [here](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/labels/2015-04%20build%20update%20issue).

Rather than pushing through for another update, we have decided to cancel the April update and
concentrate on the quality June upgrade and a better long-term build environment update planning.

The [maintenance updates](http://stspg.io/10Su) will be available.

## Downgrading MySQL to 5.5.41

With this upgrade, MySQL will be upgraded to 5.6.x.
If, for some reason, you need to stay on 5.5.41, add the following to
your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
sudo: required
before_install:
  - sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
  - sudo service mysql stop
  - sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql
  - sudo apt-get remove apparmor
  - sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-common mysql-community-server mysql-community-client mysql-client libmysqlclient18 libmysqlclient-dev mysql-server
  - sudo apt-get autoremove
  - sudo apt-get autoclean
  - sudo apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confdef" -o Dpkg::Options::="--force-confnew" install libmysqlclient-dev libmysqlclient18 mysql-client mysql-server
  - mysql -u root -e "CREATE USER 'travis'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY ''"
  - mysql -u root -e "CREATE USER 'travis'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY ''"
  - mysql -u root -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'travis'@'%'"
  - mysql -u root -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'travis'@'localhost'"
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

Notice that the instructions above requires `sudo`, and therefore must be
run on standard infrastructure with `sudo: required`.
Furthermore, the configuration will be reset to package defaults; you may
need to tweak `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` to your liking.
