Knowing the IP addresses of the build machines Travis CI uses can be helpful
when you need them safelisted to access your internal resources. Since builds
run in a variety of different infrastructures, the IP ranges to safelist depend
on the infrastructure your builds are running on:

| Infrastructure                  | IP ranges                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Container-based (travis-ci.com) | `{{ site.data.ec2_public_ips['com']['host'] }}` (`{{ site.data.ec2_public_ips['com']['ips'] | join: "`, `" }}`) |
| Container-based (travis-ci.org) | `{{ site.data.ec2_public_ips['org']['host'] }}` (`{{ site.data.ec2_public_ips['org']['ips'] | join: "`, `" }}`) |
| OSÂ X                            | `208.78.110.192/27`                                                                                             |
| Sudo-enabled Linux              | See notes below (`{{ site.data.gce_ip_range['ip_ranges'] | join: "`, `" }}`)                                     |

> **Note:** We do not have static public IP addresses available for jobs running on the

> We recommend using one of the other infrastructures if you need static IP

Note that these ranges can change in the future, and that the IP addresses used
for [notifications](/user/notifications) are different.

More details about our different infrastructures are available on the
[virtualization environments
page](/user/reference/overview/#Virtualization-environments).
