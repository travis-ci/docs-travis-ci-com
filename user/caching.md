The features described here are currently **only available for private repositories on [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com) and our new [container-based infrastructure](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/workers/container-based-infrastructure/)**.

Note that [APT caching](#Caching-Ubuntu-packages) is not available for the container-based infrastructure.

These features are also still experimental, please [contact us](mailto:support@travis-ci.com?subject=Caching) with any questions, issues and feedback.

## Cache content can be accessed by pull requests

Do note that cache content will be available to any build on the repository, including Pull Requests.
Do exercise caution not to put any sensitive information in the cache, lest malicious attacker may expose it.

## Caching directories (Bundler, dependencies)

With caches, Travis CI can persist directories between builds. This is especially useful for dependencies that need to be downloaded and/or compiled from source.

### Build phases

Travis CI attempts to upload cache after the script, but before either `after_success` or `after_failure` is
run.
Note that the failure to upload the cache does not mark the job a failure.

### Bundler

On Ruby and Objective-C projects, installing dependencies via [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) can make up a large portion of the build duration. Caching the bundle between builds drastically reduces the time a build takes to run.

The logic for fetching and storing the cache is [described below](#Fetching-and-storing-caches).

#### Enabling Bundler caching

<s>Bundler caching is automatically enabled for Ruby projects that include a Gemfile.lock.</s> *(Bundler caching is [not yet](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build/pull/148) enabled automatically)*

You can explicitly enable Bundler caching in your *.travis.yml*:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: ruby
cache: bundler
{% endhighlight %}

Whenever you update your bundle, Travis CI will also update the cache.

#### Determining the bundle path

Travis CI tries its best at determining the path bundler uses for storing dependencies.

If you have [custom Bundler arguments](/user/languages/ruby/#Custom-Bundler-arguments-and-Gemfile-locations), and these include the *--path* option, Travis CI will use that path. If *--path* is missing but *--deployment* is present, it will use *vendor/bundle*.

Otherwise it will automatically add the *--path* option. In this case it will either use the value of the environment variable *BUNDLE_PATH* or, if it is missing, *vendor/bundle*.

#### With a custom install step

Bundler caching will not automatically work if you [override the install step](/user/customizing-the-build/). You can instead use the [arbitrary directory caching method](#Arbitrary-directories) described below:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: ruby
install: bundle install --without development --deployment --jobs=3 --retry=3
cache:
  directories:
    - vendor/bundle
{% endhighlight %}

In the above example, you could also omit the install step and instead define [bundler_args](/user/languages/ruby/#Custom-Bundler-arguments-and-Gemfile-locations):

{% highlight yaml %}
language: ruby
bundler_args: --without development --deployment --jobs=3 --retry=3
cache: bundler
{% endhighlight %}

### CocoaPods

On Objective-C projects, installing dependencies via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) can take up a good portion of your build. Caching the compiled Pods between builds helps reduce this time.

#### Enabling CocoaPods caching

You can enable CocoaPods caching for your repository by adding this to your
*.travis.yml*:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: objective-c
cache: cocoapods
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to enable both Bundler caching and CocoaPods caching, you can list
them both:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: objective-c
cache:
  - bundler
  - cocoapods
{% endhighlight %}

Note that CocoaPods caching won't have any effect if you are already vendoring
the Pods directory in your Git repository.

#### Determining the Podfile path

By default, Travis CI will assume that your Podfile is in the root of the
repository. If this is not the case, you can specify where the Podfile is like
this:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: objective-c
podfile: path/to/Podfile
{% endhighlight %}

#### With a custom install step

CocoaPods caching will not automatically work if you [override the install step](/user/customizing-the-build/).
You can instead use the [arbitrary directory caching
method](#Arbitrary-directories) described below:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: objective-c
install: bundle exec pod install
cache:
  directories:
    - path/to/Pods
{% endhighlight %}

### pip cache

If you have not overridden the default [install step](/user/customizing-the-build/), use:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: python

cache: pip
{% endhighlight %}

caches `$HOME/.cache/pip`.

Otherwise use the [arbitrary directory caching method](#Arbitrary-directories) described below:

{% highlight yaml %}
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.cache/pip
{% endhighlight %}

### ccache cache

If you have not overridden the default [install step](/user/customizing-the-build/), use:

{% highlight yaml %}
language: c # or other C/C++ variants

cache: ccache
{% endhighlight %}

caches `$HOME/.ccache`, and adds `/usr/lib/ccache` to the front of `$PATH`.

Otherwise use the [arbitrary directory caching method](#Arbitrary-directories) described below:

{% highlight yaml %}
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.ccache
{% endhighlight %}

### Arbitrary directories

You can cache arbitrary directories, such as Gradle, Maven, Composer and npm cache directories, between builds by listing them in your `.travis.yml`:

{% highlight yaml %}
cache:
  directories:
  - .autoconf
  - $HOME/.m2
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, it is also possible to use environment variables in the directories.

The logic for fetching and storing the cache is [described below](#Fetching-and-storing-caches).

### Things not to cache

The cache's purpose is to make installing language-specific dependencies easy
and fast, so everything related to tools like Bundler, pip, Composer, npm,
Gradle, Maven, is what should go into the cache.

For other things, the cache won't be an improvement. Installing them usually
takes only short amounts of time, but downloading them will be the same speed
when pulled from the cache as it will be from their original source. You
possibly won't see a speedup putting them into the cache.

Things like:

* Android SDKs
* Debian packages
* JDK packages
* Compiled binaries

Anything that's commonly not changing is better suited for something like our APT
caching proxy. Please shoot us an [email](mailto:support@travis-ci.com) and
we'll see about adding your custom source to our cache.

### Fetching and storing caches

* Travis CI fetches the cache for every build, including feature branches and pull requests.
* There is one cache per branch and language version/ compiler version/ JDK version/  Gemfile location/ etc.
* Pull requests use the cache of the target of the pull request.
* If a branch does not have its own cache yet, it uses the master branch cache (unless it is a pull request, see above).
* Only modifications made to the cached directories from normal pushes are stored.

### `before_cache` phase

When using caches, it may be useful to run command just prior to uploading
the new cache archive.
For example, the dependency management utility may write log files into the directory
you are watching, and you would do well to ignore these.

For this purpose, you can use `before_cache` phase.

{% highlight yaml %}
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.cache/pip
â‹®
before_cache:
  - rm -f $HOME/.cache/pip/log/debug.log
{% endhighlight %}

Failures in this stage does not mark the job a failure.

### Clearing Caches

Sometimes you spoil your cache by storing bad data in one of the cached directories.

Caches can also become invalid if language runtimes change and the cache contains
native extensions.
(This often manifests as segmentation faults.)

You can access caches in one of the two ways.
Each method also gives you a means of deleting caches.

1. On the web https://magnum.travis-ci.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY/caches for private repositories
or https://travis-ci.org/OWNER/REPOSITORY/caches for public repositories,
which is accessible from the Settings
menu

    ![Image of cache UI](/images/caches-item.png)

2. With [command line client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis#readme):

  [ ![travis cache --delete](/images/cli-cache.png) ](/images/cli-cache.png)
  <figcaption>Running <tt>travis cache --delete</tt> inside the project directory.</figcaption>

There is also a [corresponding API](https://api.travis-ci.com/#/repos/:owner_name/:name/caches) for clearing the cache.

## Caching Ubuntu packages

<div class="note-box">
This feature is available only for private repositories.
</div>

A network-local APT cache is available, allowing for more reliable download
speeds compared to the Ubuntu mirrors.

To enable APT caching, add the following to your .travis.yml:

{% highlight yaml %}
cache: apt
{% endhighlight %}

Subsequently, all Ubuntu packages will be downloaded by way of our
cache or added to the cache for future use.

The package repositories are currently limited to a pre-selected set. If you
need to install packages from a repository not available in the list below,
[please shoot us an email](mailto:support@travis-ci.com?subject=Please add this
APT repository), and we'll add it for you.

- ppa.launchpad.net
- apt.postgresql.org
- apt.basho.com
- www.rabbitmq.com
- downloads-distro.mongodb.org
- download.oracle.com
- archive.cloudera.com
- packages.erlang-solutions.com
- repo.varnish-cache.org
- packages.ros.org
- dl.hhvm.com
- dev.mysql.com
- llvm.org
- repo.percona.com
- packages.elasticsearch.org
- debian.neo4j.org
- packages.osrfoundation.org
- dl.google.com

The standard Ubuntu repositories are included by default.

Caching Ubuntu packages will soon be enabled by default, but we're still
beta-testing the new cache until it is.

## Configuration

### Enabling multiple caching features

When you want to enable multiple caching features, you can list them as an array:

{% highlight yaml %}
cache:
- bundler
- apt
{% endhighlight %}

This does not when caching [arbitrary directories](#Arbitrary-directories). If you want to combine that with other caching modes, you will have to use a hash map:

{% highlight yaml %}
cache:
  bundler: true
  directories:
  - vendor/something
  - .autoconf
{% endhighlight %}

### Explicitly disabling caching

You can explicitly disable all caching by setting the `cache` option to `false` in your *.travis.yml*:

{% highlight yaml %}
cache: false
{% endhighlight %}

It is also possible to disable a single caching mode:

{% highlight yaml %}
cache:
  bundler: false
  apt: true
{% endhighlight %}

## How does the caching work?

The caching tars up all the directories listed in the configuration and uploads
them to S3, using a secure and protected URL, ensuring security and privacy of
the uploaded archives.

Note that this makes our cache not network-local, it's still bound to network
bandwidth and DNS resolutions for S3. That impacts what you can and should store
in the cache. If you store archives larger than a few hundred megabytes in the
cache, it's unlikely that you'll see a big speed improvement.

Before the build, we check if a cached archive exists. If it does, we pull it
down and unpack it to the specified locations.

After the build we check for changes in the directory, create a new archive and
upload the updated archive back to S3.

The upload is currently part of the build cycle, but we're looking into improving
that to happen outside of the build, giving faster build feedback.
