## Storage add-on
For user convenience, users can enable the storage add-on for uninterrupted uploads. This allows users to continue uploading images even if they exceed the storage limit.

Choose to have credits charged automatically based on storage usage, and if you exceed the storage limit when using a customized image.

Users can change the storage limit or cancel the storage add-on at any time.
