Whether your team uses GitHub Flow, feature branches or just commits directly to
master, Travis CI Enterprise supports your way of shipping code. Travis CIs’
integration with GitHub gives your team the highest confidence with every change
made.

Travis CI Enterprise is built to integrate with GitHub Enterprise. Using OAuth
for authentication, we sync your users permissions to make sure they only have
access to the repositories you want them to have access to. This allows you to
use LDAP or SAML to manage your users access. Travis CI Enterprise also
integrates with GitHub.com, allowing you greater control over your security and
to scale out your build infrastructure as needed.

## Why choose Enterprise over travis-ci.com?

Travis CI Enterprise is built to bring the features of the [hosted
platform](/user/travis-pro) to different development processes. Whether you
would like to run CI builds on-premises with your own servers or in your own
private cloud, Enterprise is equipped to fit right into your team's workflow.
Enterprise-specific features include:

* **Support for GitHub Enterprise:** You can use your GitHub Enterprise
installation as the authentication and authorization layer for Travis CI
Enterprise, allowing you to leverage your existing LDAP or SAML with no
extra configuration.
* **Meets security and regulatory requirements:**  With your servers and hosts
being deployed inside your firewall, you have full ownership and control of
your data, helping to make it possible to meet the security requirements of
your company.
* **Customizable images:**  We provide a range of build environment images,
covering an extensive set of languages, updated with the current dependencies
each community is using. If you or your team need specific changes, they are
easily customizable, which can then be deployed for use by your team.
* **Hosted on your infrastructure:** Travis CI Enterprise supports the cloud
or on-premises environment of your choice. This includes AWS, Google Compute
Engine, VMware, OpenStack and Azure.
* **Scales to your needs:** Your team has the flexibility to add as much build
capacity as needed. If it’s a busy week before a production release, all you
need to do is to start up some more capacity and let your team test to their
hearts content.
* **High availability:** Your continuous integration system is just as critical
 as your GitHub Enterprise. Travis CI Enterprise can run in a multi-node setup
 behind a load balancer, providing safety from hardware failures.

Travis CI Enterprise brings both flexibility to your CI/CD process and gives
your entire team visibility and control over the build process. And of course if
anyone has any questions, our Enterprise-specific support team is here to help
you out.
