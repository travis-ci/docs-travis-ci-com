This is a short guide to using Travis CI with your cloud platform-hosted code repository. If you're new to continuous integration or would like some more information on what Travis CI does, start with [Core Concepts for Beginners](/user/for-beginners/)
instead.

## Prerequisites

To start using Travis CI, make sure you have the following:

 * A [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Assembla](https://www.assembla.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) account.
 * Owner permissions for a project hosted on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/importing-your-projects-to-github/), [Assembla](https://articles.assembla.com/en/articles/1665737-advanced-user-permissions-controls), [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/transfer-repository-ownership-289964397.html), or [GitLab](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/gitlab/gitlab_user_permissions.htm).

## Get Started with Travis CI

Get started with Travis CI, a continuous integration service used to test and build software projects hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Assembla](https://www.assembla.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

1. **Sign up for Travis CI**. 

Go to [Travis-ci.com](https://app.travis-ci.com) and [*Sign-in with your preferred account*](https://app.travis-ci.com/signin).

   ![Travis CI Sign-in](/user/images/onboarding-travis-sign-in.png)

2. **Accept Travis CI Authorization**. 

Once redirected to your chosen platform, log into your account and accept Travis CIâ€™s authorization request. 

  If you have any doubts about the Travis CI access rights to your chosen platform, read more details here:
   * [GitHub Authorized OAuth App](/user/github-oauth-scopes/#travis-ci-github-oauth-app-access-rights).
   * [GitHub permissions used by Travis CI](/user/github-oauth-scopes).
   * [Assembla permissions used by Travis CI](/user/assembla-oauth-scopes/)
   * [BitBucket permissions used by Travis CI](/user/bb-oauth-scopes/)
   * [GitLab permissions used by Travis CI](/user/gl-oauth-scopes/)

3. **Verify your email account**. 

Travis CI sends a verification email. Check your email and verify your account to continue. Otherwise, you will have limited build functions.

4. **Select a Plan**. 

Choose the best plan for you, or get started with our Trial Plan.

   ![Plan Selection](/user/images/onboarding-select-plan.png)

5. **Credit Card Validation**. 

To commence the selected plan, you must first insert your billing information and a valid Credit Card.

   ![Payment Screen](/user/images/onboarding-payment.png)

   > **Note**: For Trial Plans, credit card authorization may result in a small fee being held on the card for a short duration. Trial Plan users are granted a small allotment of trial credits to be used within the next 14 days.

6. **Settings configurations**.

In your Travis Dashboard, click on your profile picture at the top right and select the Settings option to see a list of your available repositories.

7. **Select repositories**.

Click the **Manage Repositories** button. Once directed to your chosen platform, select the repositories you want to use with Travis CI. 

![Manage Repositories](/user/images/onboarding-manage-repositories.png)

> Depending on your chosen platform, you can also make this selection with the authorization message by clicking the *Activate all repositories* button on the Getting Started page to activate all your repos.


## Add a .travis.yml File

The next step is to add a `.travis.yml` file to your repository to tell Travis CI what to do. The following example specifies a Ruby project built with Ruby 2.2 and the latest version of JRuby.

  ```yaml
   language: ruby
   rvm:
    - 2.2
    - jruby
   ```
   {: data-file=".travis.yml"}

> The defaults for Ruby projects are `bundle install` to [install dependencies](/user/job-lifecycle/#customizing-the-installation-phase),
   and `rake` to build the project.

Add the `.travis.yml` to a specific location in your repository.

> Travis only runs builds on the commits you push *after* you've added a `.travis.yml` file.
Finally, visit [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com) and select your repository to check the build status page to see if your build [passes or fails](/user/job-lifecycle/#breaking-the-build) according to the return status of the build command.

### Assembla .travis.yml File Configuration

<blockquote class="beta">
  <p>
    This section documents the new Assembla option that is currently in beta.
  </p>
</blockquote>

For Assembla users, configure the `.travis.yml` as follows:
1. Git Repository:  in the repositories root (`main` and branches).
2. SVN Repository:
        1. In the `/trunk/` (default is `/trunk/.travis.yml`) for builds to run after commits to `trunk`.
        2. In the `/branches/<branch name>/` (e.g.,`/branches/abc/.travis.yml` for branch named `abc`) for builds to run after commits to a specific branch.
3. P4 (Perforce Helix Core) Repository:
        1. In the `/<depotname>/main/` (default is `/depot/main/.travis.yml`) for builds to run after submits to `/<depotname>/main`.
        2. In the directory respective to specific stream `/depot/<stream name>/`.travis.yml (e.g., `/depot/abc/.travis.yml` for stream `abc`) for builds to run after submits to a specific stream.

 **IMPORTANT**

Perforce depot/repository may be very heavy, so downloading it fully for build (e.g., terabytes of data) is often unwanted, as the source code to be built/tested is only a fraction of the whole depot size. To download it partially, a Travis CI user must define a specific subpath, which is later downloaded by the Travis CI build job. Such subpaths may be defined using the `perforce_test_path` tag within a `.travis.yml` file. If the property is not provided, the default behavior is downloading the whole depot/repository. 

See the example below for reference.

   ```yaml
   dist: focal
   language: ruby
   rvm:
    - 2.2
    - jruby
   perforce_test_path: /your/subpath/within/repository/which/will/be/downloaded
   ```
   {: data-file=".travis.yml"}

Perforce and SVN builds are currently **available only for Linux Ubuntu** and standard amd64 CPU architecture build environments, starting from the Bionic Beaver Ubuntu distribution.


## Switch Accounts

You can easily switch between your cloud platform provider accounts:

1. Click on your account icon in the top right corner on [Travis-ci.com](https://app.travis-ci.com).

2. Select the desired account and have fun using Travis CI.

![Switch Accounts](/user/images/onboarding-settings.png)

## Select a different programming language

Use one of these common languages:

```yaml
language: ruby
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

```yaml
language: java
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

```yaml
language: node_js
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

```yaml
language: python
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

```yaml
language: php
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

```yaml
language: go
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

If you have tests that need to run on macOS or your project uses Swift or
Objective-C, use our macOS environment:

```yaml
os: osx
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

> You do *not* necessarily need to use macOS if you develop on a Mac.
> macOS is required only if you need Swift, Objective-C, or other
> macOS-specific software.

Travis CI supports many [programming languages](/user/languages/).
