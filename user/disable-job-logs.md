## Disable build job logs availability
To increase security, repository owners have the option to have control over the availability of public Travis CI build job logs. For example, users can choose to disable access to old job logs and prevent security or confidential details from leaking into the logâ€™s historical data.  

You can choose to enable or limit access using the following security settings. 

### Enabling access to old build jobs
{{ site.data.snippets.enabling_access_jobs_logs }}

### Limiting access to build job logs
{{ site.data.snippets.limiting_access_jobs_logs }}
