If you are having trouble resolving complex build errors, or you suspect there are
significant differences between your local development environment and
the Travis CI build environment, you can restart builds in debug mode
to get shell access to the virtual machine or container.

## Enabling debug mode

Private repositories have debug mode enabled by default, and no changes need to be made.
To limit access to debug, grant users only *read access* to the repo, and use a fork + PR workflow.
For public repositories, we have to enable it on a repository basis.  
To enable debug for your public repositories, please email us at
support@travis-ci.com and let us know which repositories you want activated.

## Restarting a job in debug mode

The "Debug build" or "Debug job" button is available on the upper right corner of
the build and job pages for private repositories. For open source repositories,
this button is not available and you will need to use an API call instead.

### Restarting a job in debug mode via API

To restart a job in debug mode via API, send a `POST` request to the job's `debug` endpoint.
This request needs to be authenticated by adding your [Travis CI API token](/user/triggering-builds/)
to the `Authorization` header. You can find your API token in your Travis CI Profile page
for [public projects](https://travis-ci.com/profile).

(Note the literal word `token` must be present before the actual authorization token.)

```sh-session
$ curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Travis-API-Version: 3" \
  -H "Authorization: token ********************" \
  -d "{\"quiet\": true}" \
  https://api.travis-ci.com/job/${id}/debug
```

As public repositories do not show the Debug button, this is the only way to restart builds
in the debug mode for public repositories.

> Note that if you're still using [travis-ci.org](http://www.travis-ci.org) you need to use `https://api.travis-ci.org/job/${id}/debug` in the previous command.


#### Legacy repositories

Public repositories which have not been migrated to
travis-ci.com require you to make your API request as follows (where the asterisks should be
replaced by a token from travis-ci.org):

```sh-session
$ curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Travis-API-Version: 3" \
  -H "Authorization: token ********************" \
  -d "{\"quiet\": true}" \
  https://api.travis-ci.org/job/${id}/debug
```

#### Finding the job ID

The `${id}` is a job ID, not a build ID. For example, the ID `248927956` in the URL [`https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/docs-travis-ci-com/builds/248927956`](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/docs-travis-ci-com/builds/248927956) is a build ID. To obtain the corresponding job ID, click the _View config_ button on that page, and the URL will change into [`https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/docs-travis-ci-com/jobs/248927957/config`](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci/docs-travis-ci-com/jobs/248927957/config), showing the job ID `248927957`. Alternatively, you can obtain job IDs corresponding to a build ID [via the API](https://docs.travis-ci.com/api/#builds).

#### Echoing debug session's output to the logs

To show any command input and output you see while connected to the VM running in the debug
mode, pass an empty JSON object (`{}`) in the payload instead.

## Connecting to the job running in the debug mode

When the job starts in the debug mode, it will go through the initial steps, including setting up language
run times and caches (if applicable) and installing debug utilities.

When it is ready for your connection, you will see:

```
Debug build initiated by BanzaiMan
Setting up debug tools.
Preparing debug sessions.
Use the following SSH command to access the interactive debugging environment:
ssh DwBhYvwgoBQ2dr7iQ5ZH34wGt@ny2.tmate.io
This build is running in quiet mode. No session output will be displayed.
This debug build will stay alive for 30 minutes.
```

Running the `ssh` command above will drop you in on a live VM.

> Jobs running in debug mode will have the `TRAVIS_DEBUG_MODE` [environment variable](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables#default-environment-variables) set to `true`.

### Security considerations

At this time, there is no authentication beyond the `ssh` command displayed in
the logs.

You may choose to share the `ssh` command with another person who might be
able to help you out in debugging the build.

However, this also means that anyone who can see the command while the debug
VM is live can connect to the debug VM and potentially look at your secrets.
This is the reason that the feature is not available by default on public
repositories.

Do note that when another `ssh` connection starts, that new connection
will be attached to the session you are already in.
When you are already connected to the live debug VM, and a new user connects
to the VM using the same `ssh` command, you can see what the new user is doing.
For example, if the new user runs `env` to list all the environment variables,
you can see the output on your terminal as well.
This gives a clear indication that your secrets are at risk, and you
should take measures to mitigate any possible damage.

If you suspect malicious activity, you can either close all your windows, or cancel
the debug job on the Web UI to disconnect the attacker.

### "Permission denied" error message

Upon entering the `ssh` command, you may see an error message such as this:

```
$ ssh DwBhYvwgoBQ2dr7iQ5ZH34wGt@ny2.tmate.io
The authenticity of host 'ny2.tmate.io (104.236.9.236)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is c7:a1:51:36:d2:bb:35:4b:0a:1a:c0:43:97:74:ea:42.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'ny2.tmate.io,104.236.9.236' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Permission denied (publickey).
```

If you see this, run the command `ssh-keygen` (go through the prompts), and try again.

## Things to do once you are inside the debug VM

Once inside the debug VM, you are able to explore.

You are in a [`tmate`](https://tmate.io/) session, at the point
where your `before_install` (even if it is not defined) phase is about to
start.

### Convenience `bash` functions

Various build phases are defined in convenience `bash` functions named
`travis_run_*` (e.g., `travis_run_before_install`, `travis_run_install`).
Run these build phases to observe your build:

```
travis_run_before_install
travis_run_install
travis_run_before_script
travis_run_script
travis_run_after_success
travis_run_after_failure
travis_run_after_script
```
### See what commands actually run

You can get further insight on what these commands do.
E.g.:
```
$ type travis_run_script
travis_run_script is a function
travis_run_script ()
{
    travis_cmd wget\ https://github.com/sormuras/bach/raw/master/install-jdk.sh --echo --timing;
    travis_result $?;
    travis_cmd which\ install-jdk.sh --echo --timing;
    travis_result $?;
    travis_cmd set\ -x --echo --timing;
    travis_result $?;
    travis_cmd source\ install-jdk.sh --echo --timing;
    travis_result $?;
    :
}
```
`travis_cmd` basically executes the string argument (with escaped white spaces in the example above) and adds some decorations so that the output looks nice. In the debug sessions, you can run the string argument (unescaped) instead.

### Basic `tmate` features

`tmate` is a fork of [`tmux`](https://tmux.github.io/).
Your debug VM session uses the default configuration; thus, the command prefix is
`ctrl-b`.

A subset of functionalities are available for you in this debug session.

#### Creating a new window

```
ctrl-b c
```

The first window is indexed 0. So repeating command will give you windows
1, 2, and so on.

#### Switching to a different window

```
ctrl-b 0
```

This switches your session's focus to the window with the index 0.
You can substitute `0` with any valid index to switch to that window.

```
ctrl-b n
```

Switch to the next window.

```
ctrl-b p
```

Switch to the previous window.


Switching between windows can be helpful if you want to run long-running process in
one window while looking at the debug VM in another.

#### Scrolling up and down the terminal history

```
ctrl-b [
```

Enter the log scroll mode. Here, you can move your cursor with your arrow keys to go through the
log history.

Press `q` to exit the log scroll mode.

### Getting out of the debug VM

Once you exit from all the live `tmate` windows, the debug VM will terminate
after resetting the job's status to the original status before you restarted it.
No more phases (`before_install`, `install`, etc.) will be executed.

## Known issues

### In a Node.js debug session, the `node` and `npm` versions differ from what is defined in the configuration

To set up the debug environment in the same ways as the Node.js job,
run the following command when you log in to your debug session before
executing any other command:

```
nvm install $TRAVIS_NODE_VERSION
```
### If the debug VM crashes when running one of the `travis_run_*` functions

If your debug build crashes when running any of the specified commands, we suggest narrowing down 
the issue as follows:

1- First establish which `travis_run_*` command is failing e.g. `travis_run_before_install` crashes the debug VM.

2- Run commands one by one within the phase to find the command that crashes the debug VM e.g. if `travis_run_before_install` crashes, run the commands from in the `before_install:` phase one by one.

3- Make appropriate changes to the command that crashes the debug VM.

4- Check `bash` options. Another common cause of unexpected debug session termination is that at some point 
the [errexit](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/options.html#OPTIONSREF) option is set (set -e or set -o errexit).
 
You can confirm this with `echo $-` and check for `e` in the output:

```
$ echo $-
himBH
$ set -e
$ echo $-
ehimBH
```
With this option set, any command that exits with nonzero status will terminate the build (and the debug session, 
If it's running). You can clear this option with set +e; this may allow debug sessions to continue.

If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact support@travis-ci.com.
