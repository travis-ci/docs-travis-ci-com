[Code Climate](https://www.codeclimate.com) is a hosted platform to continuously
measure and monitor code quality.

It keeps an eye on your [code's overall quality](https://codeclimate.com/tour),
but it can also [track test
coverage](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/getting-started-test-coverage). For that purpose, it
integrates neatly with Travis CI.

As a Travis CI customer, [you get 20% off for your first three
months](https://codeclimate.com/partners/travisci)!

## Measuring Test Coverage with Code Climate

Test coverage integration can be used on both private and open source projects,
and is free for open source.

Follow their guide on [Configuring Test Coverage](https://docs.codeclimate.com/v1.0/docs/getting-started-test-coverage). In that guide you'll find: 
* links to [parallel tests
  support](https://docs.codeclimate.com/v1.0/docs/configuring-test-coverage#section-parallel-tests-and-multiple-test-suites) setup,
* [troubleshooting
  tips](https://docs.codeclimate.com/v1.0/docs/test-coverage-troubleshooting-tips),
* and a [sample .travis.yml](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/travis-ci-test-coverage).
