## What This Guide Covers

This guide covers build environment and configuration topics specific to Groovy
projects. Please make sure to read our [Getting
Started](/user/getting-started/) and [general build
configuration](/user/customizing-the-build/) guides first.

Groovy builds are not available on the OSX environment.

## Overview

Travis CI environment provides OpenJDK 7, OpenJDK 6, Oracle JDK 8, Oracle JDK 7, Gradle 1.4, Maven 3 and Ant. Groovy project builder has reasonably good defaults for
projects that use Gradle, Maven or Ant, so quite often you won't have to configure anything beyond

```yaml
language: groovy
```

in your `.travis.yml` file.

## Projects Using Gradle

### Default Test Command

if your project has `build.gradle` file in the repository root, Travis CI Groovy builder will use Gradle to build it. By default it will use

```bash
gradle check
```

to run your test suite. This can be overridden as described in the [general build configuration](/user/customizing-the-build/) guide.

### Dependency Management

Before running tests, Groovy builder will execute

```bash
gradle assemble
```

to install your project's dependencies with Gradle.

### Caching

A peculiarity of dependency caching in Gradle means that to avoid uploading the cache after every build you need to add the following lines to your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
before_cache:
  - rm -f $HOME/.gradle/caches/modules-2/modules-2.lock
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.gradle/caches/
    - $HOME/.gradle/wrapper/
```

## Projects Using Maven

### Default Test Command

if your project has `pom.xml` file in the repository root but no `build.gradle`, Travis CI Groovy builder will use Maven 3 to build it. By default it will use

```bash
mvn test -B
```

to run your test suite. This can be overridden as described in the [general build configuration](/user/customizing-the-build/) guide.

### Dependency Management

Before running tests, Groovy builder will execute

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
```

to install your project's dependencies with Maven.

## Projects Using Ant

### Default Test Command

If Travis CI could not detect Maven or Gradle files, Travis CI Groovy builder will use Ant to build it. By default it will use

```bash
ant test
```

to run your test suite. This can be overridden as described in the [general build configuration](/user/customizing-the-build/) guide.

### Dependency Management

Because there is no single standard way of installing project dependencies with Ant, Travis CI Groovy builder does not have any default for it. You need to specify the exact commend to run using `install:` key in your `.travis.yml`, for example:

```yaml
language: groovy
install: ant deps
```

## Testing Against Multiple JDKs

To test against multiple JDKs, use the `:jdk` key in `.travis.yml`. For example, to test against Oracle JDK 7 (which is newer than OpenJDK 7 on Travis CI) and OpenJDK 6:

```yaml
jdk:
  - oraclejdk7
  - openjdk6
```

To test against OpenJDK 7 and Oracle JDK 7:

```yaml
jdk:
  - openjdk7
  - oraclejdk7
```

Travis CI provides OpenJDK 6, OpenJDK 7, Oracle JDK 7 and Oracle JDK 8. Sun JDK 6 is not provided and because it is EOL in November 2012,
will not be provided.

JDK 7 is backwards compatible, we think it's time for all projects to start testing against JDK 7 first and JDK 6 if resources permit.

## Build Matrix

For Groovy projects, `env` and `jdk` can be given as arrays
to construct a build matrix.
