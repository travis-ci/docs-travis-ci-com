### What This Guide Covers

This guide covers build environment and configuration topics specific to Java projects. Please make sure to read our [Getting Started](/user/getting-started/) and [general build configuration](/user/customizing-the-build/) guides first.

## Overview

The Travis CI environment provides Oracle JDK 7 (default), Oracle JDK 8, OpenJDK 6, OpenJDK 7, Gradle 2.0, Maven 3.2 and Ant 1.8, and has sensible defaults for projects that use Gradle, Maven or Ant.

To use the Java environment add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
language: java
```

## Projects Using Maven

### Default script Command

If your project has `pom.xml` file in the repository root but no `build.gradle`, Travis CI builds your project with Maven 3:

```bash
mvn test
```

If your project also includes the `mvnw` wrapper script in the repository root, Travis CI uses that instead:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

> The default command does not generate JavaDoc (`-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true`).

To use a different build command, customize the [build step](/user/customizing-the-build/#Customizing-the-Build-Step).

### Dependency Management

Before running the build, Travis CI installs dependencies:

```bash
mvn install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
```

or if your project uses the `mvnw` wrapper script:

```bash
./mvnw install -DskipTests=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -V
```

## Projects Using Gradle

### Default script Command

If your project has `build.gradle` file in the repository root, Travis CI builds your project with Gradle:

```bash
gradle check
```

If your project also includes the `gradlew` wrapper script in the repository root, Travis CI uses that instead:

```bash
./gradlew check
```

To use a different build command, customize the [build step](/user/customizing-the-build/#Customizing-the-Build-Step).

### Dependency Management

Before running the build, Travis CI installs dependencies:

```bash
gradle assemble
```

or

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

### Caching

A peculiarity of dependency caching in Gradle means that to avoid uploading the cache after every build you need to add the following lines to your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
before_cache:
  - rm -f  $HOME/.gradle/caches/modules-2/modules-2.lock
  - rm -fr $HOME/.gradle/caches/*/plugin-resolution/
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.gradle/caches/
    - $HOME/.gradle/wrapper/
```


## Projects Using Ant

### Default script Command

If Travis CI does not detect Maven or Gradle files it runs Ant:

```bash
ant test
```

### Dependency Management

Because there is no single standard way of installing project dependencies with Ant, you need to specify the exact command to run using `install:` key in your `.travis.yml`, for example:

```yaml
language: java
install: ant deps
```

## Testing Against Multiple JDKs

To test against multiple JDKs, use the `jdk:` key in `.travis.yml`. For example, to test against Oracle JDK 7 and 8 and OpenJDK 6:

```yaml
jdk:
  - oraclejdk8
  - oraclejdk7
  - openjdk6
```

> Note that testing against multiple Java versions is not supported on OSX. See the [OS X Build Environment](/user/osx-ci-environment/#JDK-and-OS-X) for more details. 

Travis CI provides OpenJDK 6, OpenJDK 7, Oracle JDK 7, and Oracle JDK 8. Sun JDK 6 is not provided, because it is EOL as of November 2012.

JDK 7 is backwards compatible, we think it's time for all projects to start testing against JDK 7 first and JDK 6 if resources permit.

## Build Matrix

For Java projects, `env` and `jdk` can be given as arrays
to construct a build matrix.

## Switching JDKs Within One Job

If your build needs to switch JDKs during a job, you can do so with `jdk_switcher use â€¦`.

```yaml
script:
  - jdk_switcher use oraclejdk8
  - # do stuff with Java 8
  - jdk_switcher use oraclejdk7
  - # do stuff with Java 7
```

Use of `jdk_switcher` also updates `$JAVA_HOME` appropriately.
