>  The JWT addon was deprecated on May 23, 2018.

The jwt addon was introduced back in August, 2016 to provide a means of
sharing secrets with third parties (most importantly with Pull Request
authors). At the time of the introduction, we had hoped that the addon would
prove useful and secure, so that many other service providers may adopt it for
their services for our mutual usersâ€™ benefit.

Upon further consideration and investigation, however, we have determined that
the addon has shortcomings that we are unable to overcome.

Unfortunately, there is no replacement or workaround for the jwt addon at this
time. We understand that your workflows (especially the ones involving Pull
Requests) may be affected, but we ask that you phase out the use of this addon
by the deadline for security reasons.
