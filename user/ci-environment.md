### What This Guide Covers

This guide explain what packages, tools and settings are available in the Travis
CI environment (often referred to as "CI environment").

## Overview

Travis CI runs builds in isolated virtual machines that offer a vanilla build
environment for every build.

This has the advantage that no state persists between builds, offering a clean
slate and making sure that your tests can run in an environment built from
scratch.

To set up the system for your build, you can use the `sudo` command to install
packages, to change configuration, create users, and so on.

Builds have access to a variety of services for data storage and messaging, and
can install anything that's required for them to run.

## CI environment OS

Travis CI virtual machines are based on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Server Edition 64 bit.

## Environment common to all VM images

### Git, etc

All VM images have the following pre-installed

 * A (very) recent Git release from the [Peter van der Does' Git PPA](https://launchpad.net/~pdoes/+archive/ppa)
 * Mercurial (official Ubuntu packages)
 * Subversion (official Ubuntu packages)

 
### Compilers & Build toolchain

GCC 4.6.x, Clang 3.2.x, make, autotools, cmake, scons.


### Networking tools

curl, wget, OpenSSL, rsync


### Go

Go compiler/build tool 1.0.3 and 1.1.1


### Runtimes

Every worker has at least one version of

* Ruby
* OpenJDK
* Python
* Node.js
* Go compiler/build tool

to accommodate projects that may need one of those runtimes during the build.

Language-specific workers have multiple runtimes for their respective language (for example, Ruby workers have about 10 Ruby versions/implementations).

### Data Stores

* MySQL 5.5.x
* PostgreSQL 9.1.x, 9.2.x and 9.3.x
* SQLite 3.7.x
* MongoDB 2.4.x
* Redis 2.8.2 (on travis-ci.org, available in the Ruby, PHP and Java environments), Redis 2.6.x everywhere else
* Riak 1.2.x
* Apache Cassandra 2.0.x
* Neo4J Community Edition 1.7.x
* ElasticSearch 0.90.x
* CouchDB 1.3.x

### Messaging Technology

* [RabbitMQ](http://rabbitmq.com) 3.x
* [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) 2.1.x

### Headless Browser Testing Tools

* [xvfb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb) (X Virtual Framebuffer)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) 1.9.2

### Environment variables

* `CI=true`
* `TRAVIS=true`
* `CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION=true`
* `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`
* `HAS_JOSH_K_SEAL_OF_APPROVAL=true`
* `USER=travis` (**do not depend on this value**)
* `HOME=/home/travis` (**do not depend on this value**)
* `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
* `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`
* `RAILS_ENV=test`
* `RACK_ENV=test`
* `MERB_ENV=test`
* `JRUBY_OPTS="--server -Dcext.enabled=false -Xcompile.invokedynamic=false"`

Additionally, Travis sets environment variables you can use in your build, e.g.
to tag the build, or to run post-build deployments.

* `TRAVIS_BRANCH`: The name of the branch currently being built.
* `TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR`: The absolute path to the directory where the repository
  being built has been copied on the worker.
* `TRAVIS_BUILD_ID`: The id of the current build that Travis uses internally.
* `TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER`: The number of the current build (for example, "4").
* `TRAVIS_COMMIT`: The commit that the current build is testing.
* `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE`: The range of commits that were included in the push
  or pull request.
* `TRAVIS_COMMIT_MESSAGE`: The commit message from the commit that the current build is testing.
* `TRAVIS_JOB_ID`: The id of the current job that Travis uses internally.
* `TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER`: The number of the current job (for example, "4.1").
* `TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST`: The pull request number if the current job is a pull
  request, "false" if it's not a pull request.
* `TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS`: Whether or not secure environment vars are being
  used. This value is either "true" or "false".
* `TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG`: The slug (in form: `owner_name/repo_name`) of the
  repository currently being built. (for example, "travis-ci/travis-build").

Language-specific builds expose additional environment variables representing
the current version being used to run the build. Whether or not they're set
depends on the language you're using.

* `TRAVIS_RUBY_VERSION`
* `TRAVIS_JDK_VERSION`
* `TRAVIS_NODE_VERSION`
* `TRAVIS_PHP_VERSION`
* `TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION`

### Libraries

* OpenSSL
* ImageMagick


### apt configuration

apt is configured to not require confirmation (assume -y switch by default) using both `DEBIAN_FRONTEND` env variable and apt configuration file). This means `apt-get install -qq` can be used without the -y flag.

## JVM (Clojure, Groovy, Java, Scala) VM images

### JDK

* Oracle JDK 7u6 (oraclejdk7)
* OpenJDK 7 (alias: openjdk7)
* OpenJDK 6 (openjdk6)
* Oracle JDK 8 EA (oraclejdk8)

OracleJDK 7 is the default because we have a much more recent patch level compared to OpenJDK 7 from the Ubuntu repositories. Sun/Oracle JDK 6 is not provided because
it reaches End of Life in the fall 2012.

### Maven version

Stock Apache Maven 3. Maven is configured to use Central and oss.sonatype.org mirrors at http://maven.travis-ci.org

### Leiningen versions

travis-ci.org has both standalone ("uberjar") Leiningen 1.7.x at `/usr/local/bin/lein` and Leiningen 2.0 (a recent preview)
at `/usr/local/bin/lein2`.

### SBT versions

travis-ci.org potentially provides any version of Simple Build Tool (sbt or SBT) thanks to very powerful [sbt-extras](https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras) alternative. In order to reduce build time, popular versions of sbt are already pre-installed (like for instance 0.12.1 or 0.11.3), but `sbt` command is able to dynamically detect and install the sbt version required by your Scala projects. 

### Gradle version

Gradle 1.9.

Python 2.4 and Jython *are not supported* and there are no plans to support them in the future.

### Preinstalled pip packages

* nose
* py.test
* mock

## Ruby (aka common) VM images

### Ruby versions/implementations

* 2.0.0
* 1.9.3 (default)
* 1.9.2
* jruby-18mode (1.7.8 in Ruby 1.8 mode)
* jruby-19mode (1.7.8 in Ruby 1.9 mode)
* ruby-head  (upgraded every time CI passes)
* jruby-head (upgraded every time CI passes)
* 1.8.7
* ree (2012.02)

[Ruby 1.8.6 and 1.9.1 are no longer provided on travis-ci.org](https://twitter.com/travisci/status/114926454122364928).

Rubies are built using [RVM](http://rvm.io/) that is installed per-user and sourced from `~/.bashrc`.

These are only the pre-installed versions of Ruby. RVM is able to install other
versions on demand. For example, to test against Rubinius 2.2.1, you can use
`rbx-2.2.1` and RVM will download binaries on-demand.

### Bundler version

Recent 1.3.x version (usually the most recent)

### Gems in the global gem set

* bundler
* rake

## How VM images are upgraded and deployed

We currently use Vagrant to develop, test, build, export and import VM images
(a.k.a "Vagrant boxes"). Provisioning is automated using [Opscode
Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/). VM images are then uploaded to our internal
network and deployed to each individual worker during slow periods of the day
(around 03:00 GMT). VM images for different workers vary in size but in general
are **between 1.6 and 3.3 GB in size**.

This means that to provision a new PHP release (for example), we do the following:

* Update our PHP-related cookbooks and possibly tools like php-build that they depend on.
* Test cookbooks locally
* Build a new PHP VM image
* Upload the image to our internal network
* Take php1.worker.travis-ci.org down to import new images

For new releases of data stores or messaging technologies, for example, Riak

* Update our Riak cookbook
* Test the cookbook locally
* Build a new standard VM image, then worker-specific (Ruby, PHP, Node.js and so on) VM images based on the new standard image
* Upload new images to our internal network
* Take travis-ci.org workers down one by one to import new images

The entire process usually takes from one to several hours (depending on how
many VM images need to be rebuilt). Combined with the time for testing, new
releases of runtimes and other widely used software usually go live on
travis-ci.org within a week from the moment Travis Core team is notified about
the release.

## Chef Cookbooks

The Travis CI environment is set up using [Opscode
Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/). All the [cookbooks used by
travis-ci.org](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks/tree/master/ci_environment)
are open source and can be found on GitHub. travis-ci.org uses 64-bit Ubuntu
Linux 12.04 but thanks to Chef, migrating to a different Ubuntu version or
another distribution is much easier.

Chef cookbooks are developed using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/) and [Sous
Chef](https://github.com/michaelklishin/sous-chef) so cookbook contributors are
encouraged to use them.

Many cookbooks Travis CI environment uses are taken from the [official Opscode
cookbooks repository](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks). We modify some of
them for continuous integration needs and sync them periodically or as the need
arises.
