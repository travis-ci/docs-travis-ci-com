### What This Guide Covers

This guide covers build environment and configuration topics that are common to
all projects hosted on travis-ci.org, regardless of the technology. We recommend
you start with the [Getting Started](/user/getting-started/) guide and read
this guide top to bottom before moving on to [build
notifications](/user/notifications/) and [language-specific guides](/user/languages).

## .travis.yml file: what it is and how it is used

Travis CI uses `.travis.yml` file in the root of your repository to learn about
your project and how you want your builds to be executed. `.travis.yml` can be
very minimalistic or have a lot of customization in it. A few examples of what
kind of information your `.travis.yml` file may have:

* What programming language your project uses
* What commands or scripts you want to be executed before each build (for example, to install or clone your project's dependencies)
* What command is used to run your test suite
* Emails, Campfire and IRC rooms to notify about build failures

and so on.

At the very minimum, Travis CI needs to know what builder it should use for your
project: Ruby, Clojure, PHP or something else. For everything else, there are
reasonable defaults.

## Build Lifecycle

By default, the worker performs the build as following:

1. Clone project repository from GitHub
2. `cd` to clone directory
3. Checkout commit for this build
4. Install any [`apt` `addons`](user/apt)
5. Run `before_install` commands
   * Use this to prepare the system to install prerequisites or dependencies
6. Run `install` commands
   * Use this to install any prerequisites or dependencies necessary to run your build
7. Run `before_script` commands
   * Use this to prepare your build for testing
   * e.g. copy database configurations, environment variables, etc.
8. Run test `script` commands
   * Default is specific to project language
   * All commands must exit with code 0 on success. Anything else is considered failure.
9. Run `after_success` or `after_failure` commands
10. Run `after_script` commands

The outcome of any of these commands (except `after_success`, `after_failure` or `after_script`) indicates whether or not this build has failed or passed. The standard Unix **exit code of "0" means the build passed; everything else is treated as failure**.

Test result is exported to `TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT`, which you can use in commands run in `after_script` commands.

With the exception of cloning project repository and changing directory to it, all of the above steps can be tweaked with `.travis.yml`.

### Travis CI Preserves No State Between Builds

Travis CI uses virtual machine snapshotting to make sure no state is left between builds. If you modify CI environment by writing something to a data store, creating files or installing a package via apt, it won't affect subsequent builds.

## Define custom build lifecycle commands

### Overview

Travis CI runs all commands over SSH in isolated virtual machines. Commands that modify SSH session state are "sticky" and persist throughout the build.
For example, if you `cd` into a particular directory, all the following commands will be executed from it. This may be used for good (e.g. building subprojects one
after another) or affect tools like `rake` or `mvn` that may be looking for files in the current directory.



### script

You can specify the main build command to run instead of the default

    script: "./run-tests.sh"

The script can be any executable; it doesn't have to be `make`. As a matter of fact the only requirement for the script is that it **should use an exit code 0 on success, any thing else is considered a build failure**. Also practically it should output any important information to the console so that the results can be reviewed (in real time!) on the website.

If you want to run a script local to your repository, do it like this:

    script: ./script/ci/run_build.sh

In this case, the script should be made executable (for example, using `chmod +x`) and contain a valid shebang line
(`/usr/bin/env sh`, `/usr/bin/env ruby`, `/usr/bin/env python` and so on).

### before_script, after_script

You can also define scripts to be run before and after the main script:

    before_script: some_command
    after_script:  another_command

Both settings support multiple scripts, too:

    before_script:
      - before_command_1
      - before_command_2
    after_script:
      - after_command_1
      - after_command_2

These scripts can, for example, be used to setup databases or other build setup tasks.
For more information about database setup see [Database setup](/user/database-setup/).

### install

If your project uses non-standard dependency management tools, you can override dependency installation command using `install` option:

    install: ant install-deps

As with other scripts, `install` command can be anything but has to exit with the 0 status in order to be considered successful.

If you'd like to skip the `install` stage entirely, set it to `true` and nothing will be run.

    install: true

`true` is a Unix command which returns (you guessed it) 0.

### before_install

You can also define scripts to be run before and after the dependency installation script:

    before_install: some_command

Both settings support multiple scripts, too:

    before_install:
      - before_command_1
      - before_command_2

`before_install` is commonly used to update git repository submodules and do similar tasks that need to be performed before dependencies are installed.

### On Native Dependencies

If your project has native dependencies (for example, libxml or libffi) or needs tools [Travis CI Environment](/user/ci-environment/) does not provide,
you can install packages via apt and even use 3rd-party apt repositories and PPAs. For more see dedicated sections later in this guide.


### Git Submodules

Travis CI automatically initializes and updates submodules when there's a `.gitmodules` file in the root of the repository.


This can be turned off by setting:

    git:
      submodules: false

If your project requires some specific option for your Git submodules which Travis CI does not support out of the box, then you can turn the automatic integration off and use the `before_install` hook to initializes and update them.

For example:

    before_install:
      - git submodule update --init --recursive

This will include nested submodules (submodules of submodules), in case there are any.


### Use Public URLs For Submodules

If your project uses Git submodules, make sure you use public Git URLs. For example, on GitHub, instead of

    git@github.com:someuser/somelibrary.git

use

    git://github.com/someuser/somelibrary.git

Otherwise, Travis CI builders won't be able to clone your project because they don't have your private SSH key.

## Choose runtime (Ruby, PHP, Node.js, etc) versions

One of the key features of Travis CI is the ease of running your test suite against multiple runtimes and versions. Since Travis CI does not know what runtimes and versions your projects supports, they need to be specified in the `.travis.yml` file. The option you use for that varies among languages. Here are some basic **.travis.yml** examples for various languages:


### Clojure

Currently Clojure projects can be tested against Oracle JDK 8, Oracle JDK 7, OpenJDK 7 and OpenJDK 6. Clojure flagship build tool, Leiningen, supports testing against multiple Clojure versions:

* In Leiningen 1.x, via [lein-multi plugin](https://github.com/maravillas/lein-multi)
* In upcoming Leiningen 2.0, via Leiningen Profiles

If you are interested in testing against multiple Clojure releases, you can use these Leiningen features and it will work without special support on the Travis CI side.

Learn more in our [Clojure guide](/user/languages/clojure/).

### Erlang

Erlang projects specify releases they need to be tested against using `otp_release` key:

    otp_release:
      - R14B03
      - R14B04
      - R15B01

Learn more about [.travis.yml options for Erlang projects](/user/languages/erlang/).

### Groovy

Groovy projects can be currently tested against Oracle JDK 8, Oracle JDK 7, OpenJDK 7 and OpenJDK 6.

Learn more in our [Groovy guide](/user/languages/groovy/).

### Java

Java projects can be currently tested against Oracle JDK 8, Oracle JDK 7, OpenJDK 7 and OpenJDK 6.

Learn more in our [Java guide](/user/languages/java/).


### Node.js

Node.js projects specify releases they need to be tested against using `node_js` key:

     node_js:
       - "0.4"
       - "0.6"

Learn more about [.travis.yml options for Node.js projects](/user/languages/javascript-with-nodejs/).

### Perl

Perl projects specify Perls they need to be tested against using `perl` key:

    perl:
      - "5.14"
      - "5.12"

Learn more about [.travis.yml options for Perl projects](/user/languages/perl/).

### PHP

PHP projects specify releases they need to be tested against using `php` key:

    php:
      - "5.4"
      - "5.3"

Learn more about [.travis.yml options for PHP projects](/user/languages/php/).

### Python

Python projects specify Python versions they need to be tested against using `python` key:

    python:
      - "2.7"
      - "2.6"
      - "3.2"

Learn more about [.travis.yml options for Python projects](/user/languages/python/).

### Ruby

Ruby projects specify releases they need to be tested against using `rvm` key:

    rvm:
      - "1.9.3"
      - "1.9.2"
      - jruby-19mode
      - rbx
      - jruby-18mode
      - "1.8.7"

Learn more about [.travis.yml options for Ruby projects](/user/languages/ruby/).

### Scala

Scala projects specify releases they need to be tested against using `scala` key:

    scala:
      - "2.11.0-M4"
      - "2.10.2"
      - "2.9.2"

Travis CI relies on sbt's support for running tests against multiple Scala versions.

Learn more in our [Scala guide](/user/languages/scala/).

## Installing Packages Using apt

<div class="note-box">
Note that this feature is not available for builds that are running on the <a
href="/user/workers/container-based-infrastructure">container-based workers</a>,
although the <a href="/user/apt/">APT addon</a> may be used.
</div>

If your dependencies need native libraries to be available, **you can use passwordless sudo to install them** with

    before_install:
      - sudo apt-get update -qq
      - sudo apt-get install -qq [packages list]

The use of `sudo` will automatically route your project to the [standard Linux
infrastructure](/user/workers/standard-infrastructure/).  Alternatively, you may choose to make this explicit by
specifying `sudo: required` at the top level of `.travis.yml`.

The reason why travis-ci.org can afford to provide passwordless sudo is that virtual machines your test suite is executed in are
snapshotted and rolled back to their pristine state after each build.

Please note that passwordless sudo availability does not mean that you need to use sudo for (most of) other operations.
It also does not mean that Travis CI builders execute operations as root.

### Using 3rd-party PPAs

If you need a native dependency that is not available from the official Ubuntu repositories, possibly there are [3rd-party PPAs](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas)
(personal package archives) that you can use: they need to provide packages for 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04.

More on PPAs [in this article](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ubuntu-ppa-technology-explained/), search for [available PPAs on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas).


## Job Timeouts

Because it is very common to see test suites or before scripts to hang up, Travis CI has hard time limits. If a script or test suite takes longer to run, the job will be forcefully terminated and you will see a message about this in your build log.

With our current timeouts, a job will be terminated if it's still running
after 50 minutes (120 minutes on travis-ci.com), or if there hasn't been any log output in 10 minutes.

Some common reasons why test suites may hang up:

* Waiting for keyboard input or other kind of human interaction
* Concurrency issues (deadlocks, livelocks and so on)
* Installation of native extensions that take very long time to compile

There is no such timeout for a build; a build will run as long as all the jobs do.

## Specify branches to build

### .travis.yml and multiple branches

Travis CI will always look for the `.travis.yml` file that is contained in the branch specified by the git commit that GitHub has passed to us. This configuration in one branch will not affect the build of another, separate branch. Also, Travis CI will build after *any* git push to your GitHub project unless you instruct it to [skip a build](/user/how-to-skip-a-build/). You can limit this behavior with configuration options.

### White- or blacklisting branches

You can either white- or blacklist branches that you want to be built:

    # blacklist
    branches:
      except:
        - legacy
        - experimental

    # whitelist
    branches:
      only:
        - master
        - stable

If you specify both, "except" will be ignored. Please note that currently (for historical reasons), `.travis.yml` needs to be present *on all active branches* of your project.

Note that the `gh-pages` branch will not be built unless you add it to the whitelist (`branches.only`).

### Using regular expressions ###

You can use regular expressions to white- or blacklist branches:

    branches:
      only:
        - master
        - /^deploy-.*$/

Any name surrounded with `/` in the list of branches is treated as a regular expression and can contain all kinds of quantifiers, anchors, and character classes [supported](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Regexp.html) by Ruby.

Options that are usually specified after the last `/` (e.g., `i` for case insensitive matching) are not supported at the moment.
However, such options can be given inline instead.
For example, `/^(?i:deploy)-.*$/` matches `Deploy-2014-06-01` and other
branches and tags that start with `deploy-` in any combination of cases.

## The Build Matrix

When you combine the three main configuration options above, Travis CI will run your tests against a matrix of all possible combinations. Three key matrix dimensions are:

* Runtime to test against
* Environment variables with which you can configure your build scripts
* Exclusions, inclusions and allowed failures

Below is an example configuration for a rather big build matrix that expands to **56 individual** builds.

Please take into account that Travis CI is an open source service and we rely on worker boxes provided by the community. So please only specify an as big matrix as you *actually need*.

    rvm:
      - 1.8.7
      - 1.9.2
      - 1.9.3
      - rbx-2
      - jruby
      - ruby-head
      - ree
    gemfile:
      - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-2.3.x
      - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.0.x
      - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.1.x
      - gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-edge
    env:
      - ISOLATED=true
      - ISOLATED=false

You can also define exclusions to the build matrix:

    matrix:
      exclude:
        - rvm: 1.8.7
          gemfile: gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-2.3.x
          env: ISOLATED=true
        - rvm: jruby
          gemfile: gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-2.3.x
          env: ISOLATED=true

### Excluding jobs with a shorthand

If the builds you want to exclude from the matrix share the same matrix
parameters, you can only specify those, and omit the varying parts.

Suppose you have:

    language: ruby
    rvm:
      - 1.9.3
      - 2.0.0
      - 2.1.0
    env:
      - DB=mongodb
      - DB=redis
      - DB=mysql
    gemfile:
      - Gemfile
      - gemfiles/rails4.gemfile
      - gemfiles/rails31.gemfile
      - gemfiles/rails32.gemfile

This results in a 3×3×4 build matrix.
In order to exclude all jobs which have `rvm` value `2.0.0` and
`gemfile` value `Gemfile`, you can write:

    matrix:
      exclude:
        - rvm: 2.0.0
          gemfile: Gemfile

Which is equivalent to:

    matrix:
      exclude:
        - rvm: 2.0.0
          gemfile: Gemfile
          env: DB=mongodb
        - rvm: 2.0.0
          gemfile: Gemfile
          env: DB=redis
        - rvm: 2.0.0
          gemfile: Gemfile
          env: DB=mysql

### Explicit inclusion of jobs into the build matrix

It is also possible to include entries into the matrix with `matrix.include`:

    matrix:
      include:
        - rvm: ruby-head
          gemfile: gemfiles/Gemfile.rails-3.2.x
          env: ISOLATED=false

This will add the indicated job to the build matrix which has already
been built by the matrix dimensions explained above.

This is useful if you want to, say, only test the latest version of a
dependency together with the latest version of the runtime.

You can use this method to create a job matrix precisely from scratch.
For example,

    language: python
    matrix:
      include:
        - python: "2.7"
          env: TEST_SUITE=suite_2_7
        - python: "3.3"
          env: TEST_SUITE=suite_3_3
        - python: "pypy"
          env: TEST_SUITE=suite_pypy
    script: ./test.py $TEST_SUITE

will create a build matrix with 3 jobs, which runs test suite for each version
of Python.

### Rows That are Allowed To Fail

You can also define rows that are allowed to fail in the build matrix. Allowed
failures are items in your build matrix that are allowed to fail without causing
the entire build to be shown as failed. This lets you add in experimental and
preparatory builds to test against versions or configurations that you are not
ready to officially support.

Allowed failures must be a list of key/value pairs representing entries in your
build matrix.

You can define allowed failures in the build matrix as follows:

    matrix:
      allow_failures:
        - rvm: 1.9.3

### Fast finishing

If you've defined some rows in the build matrix that are allowed to fail, you might notice that the entire build won't be marked as finished until they have completed.
Or, a build won't be marked as failed until all of the jobs have finished, even if one has already failed.
You may want the build to finish as soon as possible.
To enable this, add `fast_finish: true` to the `matrix` section of your `.travis.yml` like this:

    matrix:
      fast_finish: true

Now, a build will finish as soon as a job has failed, or when the only jobs left allow failures.
