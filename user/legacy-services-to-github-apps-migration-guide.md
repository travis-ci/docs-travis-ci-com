As of May 2, 2018 we are moving toward having repositories integrated via a GitHub App instead of GitHub Services which [will no longer be supported as of October 1, 2018](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-04-25-github-services-deprecation). Here are two recipes that will show you how to migrate your private and open source repositories to GitHub App.

## How to migrate a private repository to GitHub Apps

Go to your profile page on travis-ci.com: https://travis-ci.com/profile.

Click on the "Migrate to GitHub Apps" button.

You will be redirected on the Travis CI App page on GitHub.

Type in and select the repositories that you want to migrate.

Click the "Approve & Install" button.

You'll be redirected on your Travis CI profile page and the migrated repositories will appear under the `GitHub Apps Integration` header.
