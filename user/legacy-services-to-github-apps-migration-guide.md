As of May 2, 2018 we are moving toward having repositories integrated via a GitHub App instead of GitHub Services which [will no longer be supported as of October 1, 2018](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-04-25-github-services-deprecation). 

Here are two recipes that will show you how to migrate your private and open source repositories to the Travis CI GitHub App.

## How to migrate a private repository to GitHub Apps

Go to your profile page on travis-ci.com: [https://travis-ci.com/profile](https://travis-ci.com/profile).

Click on the "Migrate to GitHub Apps" button.

You will be redirected on the Travis CI GitHub App page on GitHub.

Type in and select the repositories that you want to migrate.

Click the "Approve & Install" button.

You'll be redirected on your Travis CI profile page and the migrated repositories will appear under the `GitHub Apps Integration` header.

## How to migrate an open source repository (on travis-ci.org) to GitHub Apps (on travis-ci.com)

First, you'll need to disable your repository on travis-ci.org. To do this, go to your profile page on travis-ci.org: [https://travis-ci.org/profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile).

Search for your repository in the text box.

Click on the toggle to disable the repository on travis-ci.org.

Now you can do the steps for a private repository listed above but for your open source repository that you want to migrate.
