As of May 2, 2018 we are moving toward having repositories integrated via a GitHub App instead of GitHub Services which [will no longer be supported as of October 1, 2018](https://developer.github.com/changes/2018-04-25-github-services-deprecation). 

The following guide shows you how to migrate your private repository to the Travis CI GitHub App.

## How to migrate a private repository to GitHub Apps

Go to your profile page on travis-ci.com: [https://travis-ci.com/profile](https://travis-ci.com/profile).
