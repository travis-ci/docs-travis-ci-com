Travis CI can automatically deploy to [Datica](https://datica.com) after
a successful build.

In order to setup a deployment you need to:

### Find your Git remote

Make sure your Datica environment is [associated](https://resources.datica.com/compliant-cloud/articles/initial-setup/#sts=4. Associate to Your Environment).

Get the git remote by running `git remote -v`{: #remote} from within the
associated repository, and add it to your `.travis.yml`.

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: datica
  target: ssh://git@git.catalyzeapps.com:2222/app1234.git
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

### Set up the repository's key as a deployment key on Datica

Install the Travis CI [command line client](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb),
and get the public SSH key for your Travis CI project and save it to a file by
running:

```bash
travis pubkey > travis.pub
```

Add the key as a deploy key using the catalyze command line client within the
associated repo. For example:

```bash
catalyze deploy-keys add travisci ./travis.pub your-service
```

### Set up Datica as a known host on Travis CI

List your known hosts by running `cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts`, and find and copy
the line that includes the git remote found in [Step 1](#remote){:
data-proofer-ignore=""}.

It'll look something like:

```
[git.catalyzeapps.com]:2222 ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 BBBB12abZmKlLXNo...
```

Update your `before_deploy` step in `.travis.yml` to update the `known_hosts`
file:

```yaml
before_deploy: echo "[git.catalyzeapps.com]:2222 ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 BBBB12abZmKlLXNo..." >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

### Specifying a directory to deploy

To only deploy the `build` directory, for example, set `path`:

```yaml
deploy:
  provider: catalyze
  # â‹®
  path: build
```
{: data-file=".travis.yml"}

{% include deploy/shared.md %}
