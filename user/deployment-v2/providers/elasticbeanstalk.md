Travis CI can automatically deploy your application to [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/elastic-beanstalk/)
after a successful build.

{% include deploy/providers/elasticbeanstalk.md %}

## Creating an application without deploying it

To create an application without deploying it, simply exclude the `env` option and this will only upload the app version without deploying it to a new environment. 

## Controlling which files are included in the ZIP archive

You can control which files are included in the ZIP archive you upload with
`.ebignore` and `.gitignore`, as described in the [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-configuration.html).

{% include deploy/shared.md %}
