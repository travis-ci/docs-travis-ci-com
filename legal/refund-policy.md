## Upgrades, Downgrades, Plan Changes
- All plan changes are automatically pro-rated and adjusted:

  - Plan upgrades are pro-rated and billed within 24 hours of the plan being changed

    - **Upgrade example:**
You're on the 5-job plan. In the middle of your billing period, you upgrade to the 10-job plan. We will charge the rest of the month on the 10-job plan rate. We will also credit you the unused time on the 5-job plan, generating a dedicated invoice for the upgrade during the billing period.

  - Plan downgrades are pro-rated and adjusted automatically in the next invoice

    - **Downgrade example:**
You’re on the 10-job plan. In the middle of your billing period, you downgrade to the 5-job plan. We will charge the rest of the month on the 5-job plan rate. We will also credit you the unused time on the 10-job plan.



## Billing Schedule
For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively.

### Refunds across the Fiscal Year

Once the fiscal year is closed, we are not legally allowed to issue refunds from the previous year. As a German company, Travis CI considers the financial and tax year to match the calendar year - that is, the financial year begins on January 1 and ends on December 31.
