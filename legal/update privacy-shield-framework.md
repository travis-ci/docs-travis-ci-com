our behalf, or in response to contractual requirements. If we transfer personal information
received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, the third party’s access, use, and disclosure of
the personal data must also be in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and we will
remain liable under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove
we are not responsible for the events giving rise to such failure to comply with the Privacy
Shield obligations.

them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal data. With our Privacy Shield certification,
