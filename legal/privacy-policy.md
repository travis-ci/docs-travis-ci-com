    Your tests run in an isolated environment. The virtualized servers on which they are running on are disposed of after each run and are always restored from a snapshotted image that has no knowledge of any source code other than the code required to create our build environment.

3. **How does Travis access my source code?**

    Other than reading your .travis.yml to determine the best build strategy, the only time we access your repository directly is when checking out the source code on one of our build machines.
